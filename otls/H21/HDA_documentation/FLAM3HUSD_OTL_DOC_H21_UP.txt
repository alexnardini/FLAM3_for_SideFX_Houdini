"""Simple utility node to quickly render FLAM3H(tm) fractal flames in Solaris."""

== Welcome to FLAM3HUSD for SideFX Houdini ==
( _From H21 and up only_ )

A simple utility node to make rendering FLAM3H(tm) fractal flames in Solaris for previews easy.<br />
It offers the very fundamental functionalities to setup your fractal Flames point cloud and start rendering with Karma within a few clicks.<br />

Currently, FLAM3HUSD rely entirely on Karma CPU.

_*This tool is a prototype and it may or may not change in the future.*_<br />
_*This version is only fully compatible with FLAM3H(tm) v1.6.97 or higher.*_


@Badges

This documentation adopt the use of badges to signal some parameter's types and their scope.

_Below a list of the currently adopted badges and their meaning_:

- [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu] it is either a menu or a mini-menu.

- [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean] it is a toggle.

- [Icon:DATATYPES/string] it is a string.

- [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] it is a tip/information.

_Note that some parameters may use one or more of those badges_.


@Platforms

:platform:Windows
    This HDA and all its Python code have being extensively tested on Windows.

    
_The following platforms should function flawlessly, though I didn't get a chance to test every feature, so some may not function as intended._
    
:platform:Mac

:platform:Linux


@parameters FLAM3HUSD Tabs parameters

== Before you start == (BEFORESTART)

_Third-party applications use an_ [orthogonal|Wp:Orthographic_projection] _type of viewer in their editors_.<br />
_If you'd like to get close to a fractal Flame editor vibe, set the_ [viewport|Wp:Viewport] _to_: *Front* (_or press the key ((3)) while the cursor is on any viewport_). _Once you have done that, you can also go to the FLAM3HUSD preferences' tab and set the viewport color to: *Dark* (if not already)_.

_At the moment of this writing (up to H21)_:<br />
_It is suggested to go to the Houdini: *`Edit`*->*`Preferences`*->*`3Dviewport`* and set the Renderer to_ [OpenGL|Wp:OpenGL] _as it provide a better points visualization in the viewport when millions of them are displayed and/or their viewport point size is smaller than *`1`*(one). Changing the viewer renderer will require a restart of Houdini_.

frame viewport:
    #id: SYS
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_FrameRedSVG.svg]
    
    Re-frame current viewports based on a centered bounding box<br />
    and set all of them to type: *`Front`* (_for undistorted fractal Flames rendering_)
    
    This is being added because it occasionally happens that the camera viewport frames the current Flame really small due to some of its points ending up being really far away from the zero world position.

    _Additionally_:

    It will set the viewports clipping planes to proper values every time is invoked.

    [Icon:NETWORKS/lop] *Context aware*<br />
    - This option is context aware, and it will function only if a Lop viewer is available.

FLAM3H(tm) SOP path [Icon:DATATYPES/string]:
    #id: IMPORT
    Path to the FLAM3H(tm) node to be imported inside Solaris.<br />
    A default path is already provided to import the default first FLAM3H(tm) node name. Change this as needed.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tips*<br />
    - Once a valid FLAM3H(tm) node has been imported, FLAM3HUSD will take care of bulding a useful Scene Graph Tree.
    - When multiple FLAM3HUSD are created, the imported FLAM3H(tm) data will all be grouped under a common root named: *`FLAM3H`*

Points widths:

    The point attribute *`@pscale`* will become *`@widths`* when importing FLAM3H into Stage/Solaris.
    This option, which is a multiplier, enables rapid adjustments while Karma is rendering interactively.

    When the FLAM3H(tm) shader is in use, increasing this value will increase the additive effect if the *`Emission`* and *`Transmission`* Shader parameters are being used.

    Sometime you may want to render the handles purely for debug.

    == Renderer: FLAM3H(tm) Shader == (OPTIONSF3HSHADER)

Use Shader [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: PREFS
    *`Off`* by default.
    
    Use the FLAM3H(tm) custom MaterialX Shader.

    This shader allow you to perform color correction operations<br />
    and fine tune the point color values accumulation settings (_only from H20.5 and up_) on the fly.

    <br />

Reset Shader parms:
    #id: PREFS
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_rendererKarmaPropertiesSVG.svg]
    
    - ((LMB)) to reset the FLAM3H(tm) Shader to its default values.

    <br />

Shader parameters:
    #id: PREFS
    Inside here you have various shader parameters at your disposal:

    - *`Gamma`*:<br />Adjust the Gamma of the incoming points' color.
    - *`H`*:<br />Adjust the Hue of the incoming points' color.
    - *`S`*:<br />Adjust the Saturation of the incoming points' color.
    - *`V`*:<br />Adjust the Value/intensity of the incoming points' color.

    The following are parameters to fine-tune the point color values accumulation<br />
    to match what third-party render engines implement as: _build a buffer with the histogram or summation/accumulation of every point in every pixel_.

    The point *`widths`* parameter amplify or weaken this effect and you should find a good balance based on each Flame and its points count.
    
    - *`Emission`*:<br />Adjust the FLAM3H™ Shader emission.<br />Control how strong the light emitted by the fractal Flame points is.<br />Higher values increase the additive effect,<br />lower values decrease it until a value of *`0`*(Zero) which result in a full black color.
    - *`Transmission`*:<br />Adjust the FLAM3H™ Shader transmission.<br />Control how the emission is transmitted across the fractal Flame points.<br /><br />You should increase this value to get a correct point color values accumulation effects, with a value of *`1`*(one) being the suggested one and keep the *`Emission`* parameter' value at *`1`*(one) to start with.<br /><br />When this value is higher than *`0`*(Zero) cause the resulting rendered image to loose its Alpha channel but the visual benefits are far greater.

    <br />
    _Additionally_:

    - *`Tone map`* [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu]:<br />Choose a tone map preset to apply to the rendered image.

    <br />
    
    NOTE:
        _*`Emission`* parameter is available only<br />from FLAM3HUSD HDA versions for Houdini 19.5 and up_.

        _*`Transmission`* and *`Tone map`* parameters are available only<br />from FLAM3HUSD HDA versions for Houdini 20.5 and up_.

        _*`Emission`* and *`Transmission`* are responsable for a proper point color values accumulation and they are crucial for a correct fractal Flame look with the Karma renderer_.<br />

        _They will mimic what third-party render engines implement as_:<br />
        _*build a buffer with the histogram or summation/accumulation of every point in every pixel*_.
