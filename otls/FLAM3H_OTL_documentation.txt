_*Preface*_:

The inception of this implementation dates back to 2020, during COVID-19. 
At first, it was just a straightforward point wrangle exercise to experiment with some of the formulas from the fractal Flame algorithm.
I didn't know much about the subject at the time, but as I began experimenting with some of the free and open-source fractal Flame editors like Apophysis and Fractorium, I grew to love the field and gradually persuaded myself that I could port the entire algorithm and functionalities using Houdini out of the box.
Undoubtedly, it required some time to comprehend everything completely, but as I was also learning how to create fractal art, It slowly shaped into the proper form.

Specifically built to work in tandem with [Fractorium|http://fractorium.com],<br /> 
FLAM3H attempts to absorb as much informations as possible about its capabilities and incorporates all it can into its own toolkit.

These days, FLAM3H has all the features found in other third-party programs, plus a bunch more exclusive to this implementation.

Additionally, when combined with Houdini's procedural paradigm and toolsets, fractal flames reach previously unheard-of levels of possibilities.

@intro

[Largeicon:opdef:.?iconSVG.svg]

_Individuals and fractal flames are alike. Each one has its own personality, having gone through their own unique set of events that have helped shape who they are today._
_Consider the various formulas that make up fractal flames as different brushes or life event brushes._
_Each of these events can be identified by their patterns of self-similarity; while some have a bigger influence on the final forms and colors than others, all of them contribute to the composition as a whole._
_This is akin to a person's genome, or DNA._
_Together, all of these variables contribute to the interesting nature of the fractal Flame discipline, with its seemingly endless possibilities, effects, and patterns._

FLAM3H, as the name suggests, is the implementation of _the fractal Flame algorithm_ inside SideFX Houdini. There have been different revisions of the same algorithm in the past years, this is the implementation of FLAM3.

Fractal art is not easy at all. For this reason, it is suggested that you possess prior experience with this art form, may that be with Apophysis, Fractorium or really any other fractal Flame editor out there. This implementation was influenced by Apophysis, particularly in the fast/quick workflow design, but it has been biased in its underlying code toward Fractorium.

There is a very large, kind, and talented community out there that you can tap into and gather lots of information from to learn how to do fractal art.

Generally speaking, and based on my own learning experiences, FLAM3H can complete every tutorial you can find for any of the existing fractal Flame editors out there. The majority of tutorials you can find are for Apophysis, the first program to use the algorithm with a graphical user interface. It rose to prominence as the most widely used fractal Flame editor and will always occupy a special place in the fractal art history.

Here a few at hand:

_*[DevianArt - Apophysis tutorial: Splits Elliptic|https://www.deviantart.com/satania/art/Tutorial-Splits-elliptic-150422119]*_

_*[DevianArt - Apophysis tutorial: Spherical bubbles|https://www.deviantart.com/fiery-fire/art/Apo-Tuto-Spherical-Bubbles-127911026]*_

_*[DevianArt - Apophysis tutorial: Bipolar shapes|https://www.deviantart.com/satania/art/Tutorial-Bipolar-Shapes-213391274]*_

_*[DevianArt - Apophysis tutorial: Double wedge|https://www.deviantart.com/teundenouden/art/Double-Wedge-Tutorial-810709969]*_

_*[DevianArt - Apophysis tutorial: Hemispherical|https://www.deviantart.com/c-91/art/Hemispherical-Apophysis-Tutorial-663954258]*_


A considerable amount of effort has been allocated to ensure that, assuming that the same variations are utilized within FLAM3H and that they remain within its limitations, a one-to-one match result is consistently obtained.

Being inside Houdini has its advantages, just think of the possibilities of utilizing his procedural paradigm and tool sets to animate your fractal flames. It also makes it very easy to build a pipeline around this tool using Houdini’s Python HOM libraries.


@Platforms

:platform:Windows
    This HDA and all its Python code has been extensively tested on Windows.

    
_The following platforms should function flawlessly, though I didn't get a chance to test every feature, so some may not function as intended._

:box:
    #display: inverted teal

    *GLOBAL*
    Here, you will define the quality of the fractal Flame algorithm solution.

density:
    #id: GLOBAL
    Number of points to use. For high-quality fractals, start from 20M up to 500M and more, depending on the type of fractal Flame you end up with. As a general rule, the more, the better.
    * Must strike a balance between processing speed and quality.

    
mini-menu density presets:
    #id: GLOBAL
    Will allow you to select a density value quickly from some presets.
    
Reset density:

    Reset density to its default: 500k
        
    
iterations:
    #id: GLOBAL
    Number of iterations to use.
    
    You must experiment with the number of iterations and always go as low as possible to save on execution time.
    You went too low when the fractal Flame start to turn *_blocky_*, which happens when it crosses its own minimum.
    
    It is advised that occasionally you bump up this number a little to see if there is anything you are overlooking.
    For instance, certain Flames can seem completely different with higher number of iterations.
    
    But generally speaking, for many fratcal Flames shapes:
    
    - You do not need many iterations to get some good fractal Flames going, between 10 and 24 is usually more than you need while keeping execution speed acceptable.
    - If you increase the iterator weight, use xaos to build containers, or use some kind of variation, you will require a higher number to resolve and show you the proper result.
    
    Almost all the fractal Flames showcased inside FLAM3H's Instagram account
    use a maximum of 64 iterations, with a few exceptions reaching 96 and, in rare cases, 128/256 and more.
    
    Some flames require a truly high number of iterations to resolve properly.
    
    However, you can create some beautiful fractal Flames with just a few iterations. Below are some examples:
    
    _*[Knot clusters: 6 iterations|https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/42110232/270743580-f3c891ed-21c6-474e-89fa-62020149d821.jpg]*_
    
    _*[Dancing stars: 12 iterations|https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/42110232/270014121-b68b27d9-ebb7-4580-ad5f-9d114f2585f7.jpg]*_

mini-menu Select Iterator:
    #id: SYS

    A quick shortcut mini-menu to quickly change focus to a desired multi-parameter's tab number.

    This is handy when many iterators are created for the fractal flame you are working on.

    The bookmark icon will display the status of each iterator:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarYellowOrangeSVG.svg] when an iterator is ACTIVE.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconStarSwapRedCopyPasteSVG.svg] when an iterator is ACTIVE and marked for being copied.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionDisabledSVG.svg] when an iterator is OFF.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconStarSwapRedCopyPasteEntrieSVG.svg] when an iterator is OFF and marked for being copied.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] when there are zero iterators.

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        The menu entries are populated using each iterator's note.
    
FF:
    #id: SYS
    
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionFFDisabledSVG.svg] when FF is OFF.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionFFEnabledSVG.svg] when FF is ON.
    
    Enable and disable [finalXform|#FF] transform/iterator.

    #id: SYS
    
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionRIPDisabledSVG.svg] when RIP is OFF.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionRIPEnabledSVG.svg] when RIP is ON.
    
    Remove invalid points. *INF*, *NAN*, *Zero Opacity* and *out-of-bounds* points.

    - After the algorithm transforms the points, it is possible for some of those points to shoot to infinity. Turn this ON to get rid of those points.
    - When an iterator's opacity is *`0.0`* ( *ZERO* ), you can activate this SYS Tab's *RIP* option to get rid of those points ( since *opacity* = *`@pscale`* (*`@widths`* in Solaris ) you dnt need them anymore).
    - If rendering a Flame seems unusually slow, it's probably because certain points wind up being really far from the zero world. Those points will be eliminated if this option is turned ON.

        
F3C (flam3 compatibility):
    #id: SYS

    The behavior of the *Cos*, *Cosh*, *Cot*, *Coth*, *Csc*, *Csch*, *Sec*, *Sech*, *Sin*, *Sinh*, *Tan* and *Tanh* variations are different in flam3/Apophysis versus Chaotica.
    
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionF3CEnabledSVG.svg] *Checked*: use the Apophysis behavior.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionF3CDisabledSVG.svg] *Unchecked*: use the Chaotica behavior.

    * POST variations will be inside square brackets at the end of each iterator, or FF
    * The [iterator's weight|#FLAMEITER] value will be the last in each iterator.
    * The colons *:* indicate how many variation slots are still available ( 4 in case of an iterator VAR section, plus a last colon *:* as a separator from the iterator's weight).
    * If an iterator is disabled, it will be displayed as: " *::::::::::* "
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        The Tag icon will change when:
        
        - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_TagOBlueSVG.svg]: when the Tag is ON ( _default_ ).
        - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_TagOBlueSVG_disabled.svg]: when the Tag is OFF.
        - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_TagORedSVG.svg]: when the OUT Camera sensor viz mode is ON and update sensor option is ON.
        - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_TagORedOffSVG.svg]: when the OUT Camera sensor viz mode is ON and update sensor option is OFF.
        - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_TagOSVG.svg]: when iterator's count is zero and when Xaos is active but you cross the 20 iterators limit. ( _only in the viewport Tag_ )
        
        When in OUT Camera sensor mode, the Tag icon will turn red to allow to exit the mode also when inside a different tab other than the OUT tab.
        Once clicked, it will exit the mode and back to being the default Tag blue icon.

    This is being added because it occasionally happens that the camera viewport frames the current Flame really small due to some of its points ending up being really far away from the zero world position.

    NOTE:
        When in camera sensor mode, the re-frame will be based on the Camera sensor bounding box instead.

    The selected menu entrie is tagged with an icon based on its state:
    
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionPRIDEDisabledSVG.svg] when the selected preset name is not loaded or a palette has been loaded from the Clipboard.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionCPSVG.svg] when the selected preset name is loaded.
    
    If after loading a preset you make any modification to the loaded palette, the menu label icon will switch to a not loaded star icon: [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionPRIDEDisabledSVG.svg] indicating that the palette no longer match the one you originally loaded.

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconWhiteSVG.svg] when you load a Flame preset. This indicate that a Flame preset stats infos are visible inside the IN Tab.
    
    Usage:
    
    - ((LMB)) If there is a selected IN preset, it will reload it.
    - ((ALT)) + ((LMB)) to paste a Flame from the clipboard.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) Open a file dialog window to load a *.flame file.

    The render properties of a Flame preset loaded from the clipboard will be automatically copied into the OUT render properties on load.

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        - Loading a Flame from the clipboard is useful when going back and forth with a third-part application like for example: Fractorium.
        - In Fractorium, you can alter the Flame, copy it into the clipboard, and then load it from the clipboard inside FLAM3H to see the changes.

    This is where you'll spend the majority of your time, along with the *FF* Tab.
    
    Here you will create your fractal Flame logic.
    Since every parameter has the same name inside, if you have ever used Apophysis, Fractorium, or other fractal Flame editors, you will almost immediately feel at home.

    Every iterator acts as a container for functions, the algorithm will mix or shuffle them based on your logic.
    
    NOTE:
        The order of the iterators does not matter at all.

        For this reason, it is suggested to create them one after the other, sequentially.

copy/paste:
    #id: FLAME
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconStarSwapRedCopyPasteSVG.svg]

    All the necessary methods for copy/paste iterator's data are contained in this icon.
    
    This icon allows you to mark an iterator for being copied, and then copy the data from the marked iterator into another iterator number — even if it is located inside a separate FLAM3H node.

    When you paste the data, it wil copy everything from the marked iterator but not Xaos.
    
    Once an iterator has been marked, you can use the mini-menu next to the icon to copy individual sections from the marked iterator, including Xaos.
    
    Every item in the mini-menu is named exactly like every folder an iterator posses.
    
    When you mark an iterator, you establish a live connection with it and the data will be copied from it only when you ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) from inside another iterator either on the same FLAM3H node or on a different one.
    This way you can keep the iterator marked while working and paste again its data somewhere else after making additional changes to its contents.

    Below are the different options on how you can use this icon:
    
    - ((LMB)) to mark this iterator for being copied. If already marked, it will unmark it.
    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) to copy the values from the marked iterator into this iterator.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) to unmark this FLAM3H node marked iterator for being copied.
    
    Additionally:
    
    - ((ALT)) + ((LMB)) to reset this iterator to its default values.

    Enable/Disable this iterator.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        If an iterator is disabled, it won't be included when saving the Flame out into a Flame file.
        In case you still want to include the inactive iterator in the file, set its Weight to zero instead.

    _From Fractorium help page._
    
    *What is Xaos ?*
    
    Xaos provides more fine-grained control over the selection of xforms on each iteration.
    It is expressed as a probability modifier for each xform in relation to every other xform.

    The default state is for all elements to have a value of 1, which means that xaos is not used.
    When any element is changed to something other than 1, xaos is in effect.

    Xaos specifies how likely a xform is to be chosen based on the previous xform that was chosen.
    Alternatively, this can also be expressed as the probability modifier of the next chosen xform based on the currently chosen one.
    These two methods of stating xaos are known as “from” and “to”.

    _The above image shows five iterators with one variation each and how they are connected to each other through a hypothetical Xaos setting._
        

    
    The default mode is xaos TO. You can change it to use xaos FROM mode instead in the preferences tab.
    
    _xaos TO and xaos FROM are at their core each other's reflections. This means they are the same data, but one is the transpose of the other._
    
    _A matrix transpose is a matrix flipped along its diagonal. Think of it as looking at the same matrix from 2 opposite points of view._
    
    Looking from an iterator's point of view:
    - When in xaos_TO mode, you will think: *to* wich iterator am I allowed to send the points I just executed?
    - When in xaos_FROM mode, you will think: *from* wich iterator am I allowed to receive points before I execute them myself?
    - Note _that the same concept applies also to the iterator itself, this means the question will be: can I execute a point after I already executed it myself? ( like the yellow iterator with the *Curl* variation in the above diagram/image. )_
    

        
    *How to set xaos in FLAM3H*:
        
    - To set XAOS for a Flame with 4 iterators, use the "*xaos:*" keyword followed by each iterator's weight values separated by a colon: *xaos:1:2:3:4*.
    - When the auto space xaos weights option is ON ( it is OFF by default ), the xaos keyword will look like this: "*xaos :*". The important information here is that you always need a colon "*:*" after the word "*xaos*" to make it work.
    - If no set or when using a short descriptive note, FLAM3H will assume all XAOS values are 1.0, the equivalent of: *xaos:1:1:1:1*
    - If you set only iterator 1 and iterator 2, FLAM3H will always fill in the rest with a value of 1.0. *xaos:0:0* will be interpreted as *xaos:0:0:1:1*
    - When turning iterators ON and OFF and removing or adding them, FLAM3H will internally remove and reformat XAOS values to account for missing iterators. It is fully automatic.
    
    *Xaos command options*:
    
    - If you type a non-numeric character in any of the xaos's weights, FLAM3H will undo to what you had before.
    - If you dnt use the "*_xaos_*" keywork at the beginning of the string, the entire xaos string will be reset to all weights with value: *`1`*
    - If you just type a number, the entire xaos string will be reset to all weights set to that number.
    - If you just type a floating point number, the entire xaos string will be reset to all weights set to the integer part of that number. ( _ex: 123.876 will become -> 123_ )
    - If you type a negative number, it will be reset to a value of:  *`1`*

    TIP:
        #display: orange
    
        XAOS is off by default, and FLAM3H will activate it automatically
        only when needed. (ex: when one of its weights is set to a value different from: *`1`* ).
        
    NOTE:
        When saving out Flame files, XAOS FROM mode will internally be converted into XAOS TO on save and reloaded as XAOS TO.

        _Each iterator allows up to 8 variations ( pre blur, 2 PRE, 4 VAR and 1 POST) to be used._
        
        _Variation names that end with an asterisk(*) are dependent, while those that end with three dots(...) are parametric._
        
        _When using parametric variations, their parameters in the VARS Tab will be shared between all of them._
        _This means that if you use 2 PRE Mobius, 4 VAR Mobius and 1 POST Mobius, they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters._

    Pre_blur variation in this implementation is hard-coded inside the chaos game to be as fast as it can possibly be.
    It will always be the first pre-variation the algorithm runs.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        When authoring your Flame in Fractorium or Apophysis, if you are planning to load them inside FLAM3H
        remeber that the variation "pre_gaussian_blur" will be remapped to "pre_blur" on Flame load by default.
        
        You can change this beahavior and load the "pre_gaussian_blur" variation instead, if any, inside the IN Tab.

        Laying down a new FLAM3H node and activating the Final Flame transform with the default Sierpiński triangle (*FF*) will allow you to experiment with the variations and see what happens.
        Don't forget to play around with the affine coefficients a bit to see what you can obtain.

    The weight of the selected variation. Zero will be inactive, and 1 will be 100%.
    Can be set higher than 1 and negative too.
    * If more than one variation is active, remember that, as a general rule, it is suggested ( not mandatory ) to have the sum of all weights equal to 1.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        
        In order to lower the cost of the computation, it is preferable to set a variation weight to zero rather than retaining it at extremely low values if their impact is negligible.
        The variation will be fully disregarded at zero.

    Enable post affine.
    
pre affine:
    #id: FLAME
    Affine transformation's coefficients for the current iterator ( xform ).
    
    NOTE:
        A linear transformation cannot be used to translate a set of points. 
        
        To translate a set of points, we need to use an *_affine transformation_*. 

        An _affine transformation_ multiplies a vector by a matrix, just as in a linear transformation, 
        and then adds a vector to the result ( the *`O`*._`xy`_ component ). 

        This added *`vector2`* carries out the translation. 

        By applying an _affine transformation_ to an image on the screen, we can do everything a linear transformation can do, 
        and also have the ability to move the image up or down and left or right.

    Each iterator( xform ) has an affine transform that is always applied on every iteration.
    This is known as the pre affine becasue it is applied before the variations.

    - With *`X`*._`xy`_ and *`Y`*._`xy`_ you will apply rotation and scale/shear while with *`O`*._`xy`_ you will apply translation/offset.
    - They compose a 2x3 matrix ( *`X`*._`xy`_, *`Y`*._`xy`_, *`O`*._`xy`_ ).
    - The rotation parameter will take the values of *`X`*._`xy`_, *`Y`*._`xy`_, *`O`*._`xy`_ and rotate them ( *`O`*._`xy`_ being the pivot).
    
    There are two ways you can use the affine:
    # Use *`X`*._`xy`_, *`Y`*._`xy`_, *`O`*._`xy`_ for everything ( translation, rotation and scale/shear ).
    
    # Use the rotation parameter in combination with: *`X`*._`x`_ and *`Y`*._`y`_ for scale, *`X`*._`y`_ and *`Y`*._`x`_ for share and *`O`*._`xy`_ for translation.
    
    NOTE:
        The resulting affine coefficients after the rotation parameter is applied are not updated in the UI but passed directly internally to the algorithm.

    *CP:* _Flame fractal color palette._
    
    The palette colors used in a successful fractal Flame are crucial.

    When loading a palette, FLAM3H will either set the HSV values to the one stored into the loaded palette preset, or reset them to their defaults otherwise.
    
    Check this option to keep the current HSV values unchanged after loading a palette preset.
    
HSV:
    #id: PALETTE
    
    Hue/Saturation/Value of the palette's colors.
    
    HSV values are exported into the XML on Flame save when used.
    
HSV reset:
    #id: PALETTE
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarWhiteSVG.svg]
    
    Reset the HSV to their default values.
    
palette lookup samples:
    #id: PALETTE
    
    The amount of lookup samples to use to sample this palette.
    
    Lookup samples have no connection on the palette you design. Only a few color keys can be made;
    nevertheless, the palette will be internally sampled (linearly spaced) from ZERO (start) to ONE (end) using this amount of samples.
    
    The amount of linearly spaced color keys in a typical fractal Flame is equivalent to 256, which is the default.
    
    However, if you create a palette with more than 256 color keys you might eventually want to use an higher amount of samples to be sure to catch all the subtle color variations of the palette.
    
    In general, 256 lookup samples will always be good.
    
    NOTE:
        - Saving out a Flame into a file, will also save the palette lookup samples value so that you can restore it once you load the Flame back into FLAM3H.
        - If you are loading a Flame file preset from another software or from older versions of FLAM3H without the lookup samples XML key in the file, the default value of 256 will be used instead.
        - Saving a Flame out will always save the palette with 256 color's keys. If you created a palette with more than 256 colors, for example with 1024 color keys and sample it with 1024 samples to take into account all the subtle color changes, *save the hip file instead*.

save palette 256+ (CP):
    #id: PALETTE
    ON by default.

    Allow the palette to be saved with more than the standard 256 colors assuming you created a palette with those many colors.

    It will use a banding system to determine how many colors/samples to use:

    - Anything below 256, it will try to downsample based on internally defined rules.
    - Anything above 256 and below/equal 512, it will use 512 colors/samples on save.
    - Anything above 512 and below/equal 1024, it will use 1024 colors/samples on save.
    - Anything above 1024 it will be clamped at 1024 colors.

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        When you are adding more than 256 colors keys to the palette either by editing it or by loading a Flame or Palette preset with that many colors, a message in the CP tab UI will show up as: `[256+]`
    
save Palette HSV:
    #id: PALETTE
    OFF by default.
    
    When saving out a palette, FLAM3H use the non-color-corrected ramp by default and save the HSV values along with it if used ( different from default values ).
    
    Check this option to save the the color-corrected HSV ramp instead. 
    
    This option will clamp the palette colors on save to 0-255 and you should use this only when you want to export the desired colors to be loaded inside Fratorium or Apophysis or other fractal Flame editors out there.

    == IN == (INF)

IN file ( *.flame type ):
    #id: IN
    
    Load *.flame files. They can come from FLAM3H or also authored with Apophysis, Fractorium and other flam3-compatible applications.
    
    The only restrictions are:
    
    - The Flames contained in the file must use the same variations included inside FLAM3H. 
    - A maximum of 3 PRE ( pre_blur plus 2 of your choise ), 4 VAR and 1 POST variations for each iterator are allowed. 
    ( for a total of 8 vars per iterator ). If it finds more on load, it will just discard the extra one.
    - For FF ( FinalXForm ) you have 1 PRE, 2 VAR and 2 POST available. If it finds more on load, it will just discard the extra one.
    
    NOTE:
        FLAM3H does not deal with any image color correction curves that are present inside Fractorium for example.

        Every time you load a Flame authored with Fractorium, those curves' values will be discarded and internally reset to their default values. ( no color correction at all )
    
Reload:
    #id: IN

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconWhiteSVG_disabled.svg] when no Flame preset has been loaded.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconWhiteSVG.svg] when you load a Flame preset. This indicate that a Flame preset stats infos are visible inside the IN Tab.
    
    Usage:
    
    - ((LMB)) If there is a selected IN preset, it will reload it.
    - ((ALT)) + ((LMB)) to paste a Flame from the clipboard.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) Open a file dialog window to load a *.flame file.

    When loading a Flame preset from the clipboard, its render properties will be automatically copied into the OUT render propperties on load.

    If a Flame preset contain more variations than the allowed number in any of the available sections (PRE, VAR, POST) in an iterator or FF, the variations in excess will be skipped and printed to the console.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        - Loading a Flame from the clipboard is useful when going back and forth with a third-part application like for example: Fractorium.
        - In Fractorium, you can alter the Flame, copy it into the clipboard, and then load it from the clipboard inside FLAM3H to see the changes.

    #id: IN
    Every *.flame file can contain multiple Flames.
    As many entries as there are Flames in the file you are loading will be added to this preset menu.

Iterations on Load (int):
    #id: IN
    Set a number of iterations to use every time you load a Flame from a *.flame file.
    This will override the internal default value of 64 iterations.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        If "*auto add iter num to Flame name*" OUT Tab option is *OFF*:
    
        The iteration number you want your fractal Flame to use when you load it back into FLAM3H can be baked into the preset name you choose for it.

        For instance, the Flame preset "*My_Awesome_GrandJulia*" will be loaded with 64 iterations by default.

        However, all settings will be overridden if you add the iteration number to the preset name after a double colon, as in "*My_Awesome_GrandJulia::16*".
        and load it with an iteration count of 16.
        
        Therefore, do some tests before saving it, and choose the ideal iteration number to incorporate into the preset name.
        
        If you like, you can manually edit the created XML/Flame file and change the *flame-> "name"* key afterwards.
    
Force iterations on Load:
    #id: IN
    When *.flame files are loaded, FLAM3H immediately sets the iteration number to 64, which seems like a reasonable count to resolve the majority of them rather effectively.
    However, if you need to act quickly, you can use this number to override the iterations set on load.

    When you save it out and load it back into, say, Fractorium, you can be sure that your Flame will match the visual parameters of the Flame you just loaded.

    When loading a Flame preset from the clipboard, its render properties will be automatically copied into the OUT render propperties on load and this icon will become disabled.
    
    NOTE:
        Any image color correcting curves, such as those found in Fractorium, are not handled by FLAM3H.
        
        These curves will be overwritten with their default values each time you save a Flame from FLAM3H. (no color correction)

        This means that if you save a Flame out again from FLAM3H after loading a Flame created with Fractorium that makes use of its color correcting curves, those curves will be lost.

    _FLAM3H allows you to save your flames in the standard *.flame file format_
    _so that you can load them back inside any other applications like Fractorium, Apophysis and others._
    
    _You must abide by some rules imposed by the original Flame file format._
    
    _Not using multiple instances of the same variation in any of the accessible sections (PRE, VAR, or POST) is the most crucial thing to keep in mind._
    
    _For instance, you cannot utilize two Mobius variations inside an iterator's PRE or VAR sections._
    _But you can use 1 Mobius in the PRE vars, 1 Mobius in the VAR, and 1 Mobius in the POST._
    
    _FLAM3H, by design, will allow you to be more flexible with your Flame construction choises and allow_
    _you to bend this rule, enabling the use of the same variation multiple times within the same section ( Chaotica style ), but you won't be able to save out_
    _the result in the standard Flame file format._

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        When you have finished creating a FLAM3H library, you can rename the file to begin with "*F3H_LOCK*" to prevent any future alterations.

    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) will open the file explorer to the file location.
    - ((ALT)) + ((LMB)) to copy this Flame into the clipboard.

    - If the selected file does not exist, it will be created.
    - If the selected file is not a valid Flame file type, nothing will happen.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        *Once you click save*:
        
        - If you select a location and a filename without an extension, it will automatically add the _*.flame*_ extension to them.
        - If you do not provide a file name at all, it will generate one for you based on today's date and current time, assuming you have a valid location selected.
        - If nothing is selected (ex: OUT file empty or invalid ), nothing will happen.
        
        *Also*:
    
        - When saving out flames files, it will always sample and save the palette as a 256-color palette standard.
        - If you created a palette with more than 256 colors, for example with 1024 color keys and sample it with 1024 samples to take into account all the subtle color changes, *save the hip file instead*. 
        
    NOTE:
        Keep in mind that you can not utilize a variation more than once in any of the available variation's types. 

        While this is doable within the tool, it is not compatible with the FLAM3 file format as it requires that a variation be used only once per type ( types: PRE, VAR, POST )
        or you won't be able to save the same result.

        Save the hip file instead.
        
        This is true also for applications like Apophysis and Fractorium as they obey the same rule.

        If "*auto add iter num to Flame name*" is *OFF*:
    
        The iteration number you want your fractal Flame to use when you load it back into FLAM3H can be baked into the preset name you choose for it.

        For instance, the Flame preset "*My_Awesome_GrandJulia*" will be loaded with 64 iterations by default.

        However, if the iteration number is added to the preset name after a double colon, as in "*My_Awesome_GrandJulia::16*," it will override all settings and load the preset with 16 as the iteration numbers.
        
        Therefore, do some tests before saving it, and choose the ideal iteration number to incorporate into the preset name.
        
        If you like, you can manually edit the created XML/Flame file and change the *flame-> "name"* key afterwards.

    Show Flame name's informations and tips.
    
OUT file contents ( info ):
    #id: OUT
    This menu is simply provided as information.
    If there are any Flames in the chosen output file, they will be displayed.
    This menu will refresh once you add a new Flame to it.
    It will always be set to the last Flame’s name you saved.

    == OUT: options == (OUTOPTIONS)

save palette 256+ (OUT):
    #id: PALETOUTTE
    OFF by default.

    When switched ON,

    will allow the Flame to be saved with more than the standard 256 colors assuming you created a palette with those many colors.

    It will use a banding system to determine how many colors/samples to use:
    
    - Anything below 256, it will always sample and save the Flame using a palette with 256 colors.
    - Anything above 256 and below/equal 512, it will use 512 colors/samples on save.
    - Anything above 512 and below/equal 1024, it will use 1024 colors/samples on save.
    - Anything above 1024 it will be clamped at 1024 colors.

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        - Fractorium will work properly when loading a Flame with more than 256 colors.
        - When you are adding more than 256 colors keys to the palette either by editing it or by loading a Flame or Palette preset with that many colors, a message in the CP tab UI will show up as: `[256+]`

    :warning:
        *Apophysis v7.x will error out if you try to load a Flame with more than 256 colors.*
        
        
Save palette HSV (cc):
    #id: OUT
    OFF by default, as FLAM3H will save the HSV values into the XML file and set those once you load it back.

    If enabled, all color adjustments you may have made to the Flame's palette will be preserved saving the HSV ramp instead.

    It is helpful if you want to maintain the color-corrected palette when you load the saved Flame into a different program, such as Fractorium or Apophysis.

    This option will clamp the palette colors on save to 0-255 and you should use this only when you want to export the desired colors to be loaded inside Fratorium or Apophysis or other fractal Flame editors out there.
    
Auto add iter num to Flame name:
    #id: OUT
    ON by default. It will automatically append the iteration number to the Flame name you enter.
    It will also autocorrect the Flame name string based on internally defined rules.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        When on, and once you type in a Flame name, changing the iteration number will update the Flame name too.
        
use Fractorium parametric prm names:
    #id: OUT

    OFF by default. To export the parameter names for parametric variations to the one that Fractorium uses, check this toggle ON when saving out a Flame.

    *_This is only useful if you use Mobius or Oscilloscope ( oscope ) parametric variations and want to load the Flame inside Fractorium as it uses diferent paramtric paramter's names for these_*.

    NOTE:
        When this option is ON, an extra XML key will be added to each xforms with the name of: *`color_speed`*

        This extra key value is used by Fractorium to properly re-set its own iterator's colors to match what you had inside FLAM3H in Houdini.

    
    :dev:
    :disclosure:Technical note
    
        When saving a Flame out with this option on, the xml appliction key will change from:
        
        {{{
        #!xml
        <flames>
          <flame version="FLAM3H-WIN-1.3.37" ... >
              ...
        }}}
        
        to:
        
        {{{
        #!xml
        <flames>
          <flame version="EMBER-FLAM3H-WIN-1.3.37" ... >
              ...
        }}}
        
        Note the " _EMBER_ " prefix added to the FLAM3H version name.
        
        This way once we load it back FLAM3H will remap those parameteric variations parameter's names to the proper one.

    == OUT: Edit properties == (OUTEDIT)

    
Edit render properties:
    #id: OUT
    Allow the editing of the render properties for the host application you will load the saved Flame file into.

    Fractorium is the suggested one, followed by Apophysis.
    
    Those properties are specific to the renderer of the application you will load the saved Flame into.

    Some of the properties are specific to Fractorium applications, which has been my point of reference.
    
    They will control how the saved fractal Flame will render inside other applications like Fractorium and Apophysis.
    They are their renderer settings, and they will be exported into the XML file.

    
    NOTE:
        Any image color correcting curves, such as those found in Fractorium, are not handled by FLAM3H.

        These curves will be overwritten with their default values each time you save a Flame from FLAM3H. (no color correction)
        
        This means that if you save a Flame out again from FLAM3H after loading a Flame created with Fractorium that makes use of its color correcting curves, those curves will be lost.
        
    
Reset render properties:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_TagORedOffSVG.svg] when Sensor Viz is ON and update sensor option is OFF.
    
    Activate FLAM3H Camera sensor visualization.
    
    All the render settings required by third-party programs such as Apophysis and Fractorium are stored together with the fractal flames when they are saved from FLAM3H.

    A portion of the render parameters deal with the camera and how the fractal Flame you just saved is framed.

    The FLAM3H camera sensor will precisely display the image framing.

    _This is meant to be used only when you intend to load the saved fractal Flame into third-party programs and you desire to setup the fractal Flame image framing in Houdini first. Below a screenshot as an example:_

    _*[FLAM3H to Apophysis, camera sensor framing|https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/42110232/281850238-27f1d534-f6a7-4519-990d-373f3290cc5b.jpg]*_

    When multiple FLAM3H node are present in the scene, FLAM3H ensures that, upon entering the Camera Sensor viz mode, there will only ever be one active Camera Sensor viz mode at any given time. This keeps the current viewport from jumping when concurrently stashed viewports are restored and saved at the same time.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        When in OUT Camera sensor mode, the SYS tab Tag icon will turn red to allow to exit the mode also when inside a different tab other than the OUT tab.
    
Resolution:
    #id: OUT
    The image resolution.

    Select a resolution out of some pre made presets.
    
    
Copy/Paste render properties:
    #id: IN
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconStarSwapRedCopyPasteSVG.svg]
    
    When you load a Flame file in the IN tab, this icon will become available.
    
    When you click this icon, the currently loaded IN Flame preset render properties will be copied and pasted here.

    When you save it out and load it back into, say, Fractorium, you can be sure that your Flame will match the visual parameters of the Flame you just loaded.

    The render properties of a Flame preset loaded from the clipboard will be automatically copied into the OUT render properties on load, disabling this icon.
    
    NOTE:
        Any image color correcting curves, such as those found in Fractorium, are not handled by FLAM3H.
        
        These curves will be overwritten with their default values each time you save a Flame from FLAM3H. (no color correction)

        This means that if you save a Flame out again from FLAM3H after loading a Flame created with Fractorium that makes use of its color correcting curves, those curves will be lost.
    
Center:
    #id: OUT
    Where the Flame is centered, think of this as the look at camera point.
    
Rotate:

    The camera rotation.
    
Scale:
    #id: OUT
    Size of the lens. Because the quality won't be raised once loaded into third-party programs such as Fractorium or Apophysis, you will need to manually alter it from within the host program, making this XML key an affordable way to achieve zoom.
    
update camera sensor:
    #id: OUT
    ON by default. Every change to the sensor parameters will update the sensor viewport viz. Turn this OFF to disable any sensor viewport's updates.

    NOTE:
        Double accuracy in 64 bits will be incredibly slow. I'll say it again: "Really slowly."

        Unless you see some significant artifacts and you genuinely adore the fractal Flame you are working on, always use 32-bit.

    *FLAM3H Rendering tips*. _A few small tips to render your fractal Flame images._

    Workflow tips:
        #id: rendering
    
    You can keep the FLAM3H node live without the need to bake the processed point cloud while rendering
    and just change density values to go from low/quick renders to high/slow render times. Adjust the point size *`@pscale`* ( in Solaris: *`@widths`* ) accordingly.

    When using Karma renderer:

    - With 64gb of physical memory you will be able to render 500M points without weight much on virtual memory.
    
    - With 128gb of physical memory you will be able to render 1 billion points without weight much on virtual memory.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        When using Mantra, you can take advantage of _delayed loads_ to greatly increase the amount of points you can render, in which case you must bake those points out in a *`*.bgeo.sc`* files first.
        
        A non-deterministic random number generator was used to construct FLAM3H, and it lies at the heart of the algorithm.
        As a result, the points produced by FLAM3H nodes will always be in a little bit of a different location every time it cook.
        This is perfect for cloning FLAM3H nodes and layering them into a single fractal Flame to improve the quality of the final result.

    Point size:
        #id: rendering
    
    For simplicity, FLAM3H sets all *`@pscale`* to a value of *`0.001`*.
    Any necessary adjustments can be made using a wrangle or the upstream geometry node point size multiplier.
    It's important to keep in mind that *`@pscale`* will become *`@widths`* when importing FLAM3H into Stage/Solaris.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        As a general rule, the more points, the smaller the *`@pscale`* or *`@widths`* values need to be.

    Karma/Mantra tips:
        #id: Karma/Mantra tips
    
    - When rendering with Karma, remember to turn on the "_Simplified lighting_"/"_Disable lighting_" option to be sure to render the points with their full color values.
    
    - When rendering with Mantra, just create a constant shader that uses the *`@Cd`* attribute.
    
    It will be crucial to experiment with the CP Ramp HSV values, notably the "*S*" (Saturation) and, most crucially, the "*V*" (Value).
    The more dense portions of the Flame will get brighter if the Value in HSV is increased from the default value of 1.0, bringing the appearance of the Flame closer to that of a typical fractal Flame.

    *FLAM3H Cvex*: _How to Compile and update_.
    
    In this section, you will find information on how to compile and then update FLAM3H Cvex code in case you'd like to modify/extend its core functionalities.
    For example, you may want to add more variations to its current arsenal of already implemented variations ( currently there are 106 implemented ).
    
    Extending the Cvex code base, most likely require you to update/extend the Python code base as well, since both go hand in hand with many of the core algorithm functionalities.
    
NOTE:
    _In order to improve speed, the Cvex code base has been scaled down to its bare minimum; this results in the least amount of code required to implement the entire algorithm._

    _Be as conservative as you can if you want to add anything._


== Cvex: How to compile == (COMPILE)
    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    Compile CVEX:
        #id: CVEX
    
    *SideFX made this part very easy*:
    
    # Open a Houdini 19 or higher, Command line Tools shell
    # Navigate into the directory where the cvex source files are located
    # To compile any of the available cvex source files, run this command:
    
        {{{
        #!vex
        vcc -c cvex sourceFile.vfl -o outputFile.vex
        }}}
    
    - *vcc* is the name of the Houdini's cvex/vex compiler
    - *-c* to specify a Houdini context, in this case the context is: *cvex*
    - *-o* to specify an output filename ( *.vex* extension )
    
    The FLAM3H source files are already named as expected.
    
    - For FLAM3H, the output file name must be the same as the input source file name ( only the file extension will be different, of course ).
    
        - Source -> _TheFractalFlameAlgorithm_._*vfl*_ 
    
        - Output -> _TheFractalFlameAlgorithm_._*vex*_
    
== Cvex: How to update FLAM3H node == (UPDATE)
    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    Reload CVEX:
        #id: CVEX
    
    Inside the FLAM3H node, you will find many wrangle core nodes running a compiled Cvex file.
    
    If you end up updating the Cvex code yourself by extending it: 
    
    # Update the sourceFile.*vfl* with all the changes/additions you desire, and follow the above steps on *How to: Compile CVEX*.
    # Once you are ready, remove the old compiled Cvex file from: *FLAM3H*->*Type properties*->*extra files*.
    # Locate the new compiled Cvex file and load it back inside *FLAM3H*->*Type properties*->*extra files* section.
    # Before you click: *Add file*, remove the extension from the filename inside the "*Section name*"
        - ex: From: _*TheFractalFlameAlgorithm.vex*_ To: _*TheFractalFlameAlgorithm*_
    # Click *Apply* or *Accept* to confirm your changes.
    # Go inside the FLAM3H node and on any of the wrangle core nodes, click the:
    
        * "Reload CVEX" icon: [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_TagORedSVG.svg]
    
    You just need to click it once, and it will reload all the compiled Cvex code files included, the Wrangle Core node you click the icon from is not important.
    
    Once clicked and as soon as FLAM3H cook again, it will Re-Compile all FLAM3H CVEX nodes. Depending on your PC configuration it can take up to 1 minute. It is a one time compile process.

@Limitations

:box:
    #display: inverted pink

    *FLAM3H: Limitations*.
    
    The following are limitations to keep in mind when authoring your flames in Fractorium or Apophysis to be loaded inside FLAM3H.
    All of those restrictions are in place to maintain performance within the CVEX language restrictions.

== Limitations: Iterator's count ==
    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    Iterator's count:
        #id: Limitations
    
    FLAM3H allows you to create as many iterators as you wish; however, When using XAOS, you are only permitted to create a maximum of 20 iterators.
    
    _This is a workaround to make XAOS work due to a Houdini bug: *Bug ID# 124486*, *SideFX Support Ticket SESI #128304*_

== Limitations: Iterator's PRE, VAR and POST variations ==

:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    PRE variations:
        #id: Limitations
    
    Every iterator is capable of 3 PRE variations, with one ( the first one to always be executed ) being: pre_blur, followed by the other two.
    
    It is really pre_blur + 2 variations of your choice.
    
    NOTE:
        _*The weight of the PRE variations can not be negative* in FLAM3H._

:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    VAR variations:
        #id: Limitations
    
    Every iterator is capable of 4 variations.
    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    POST variations:
        #id: Limitations
    
    Every iterator is capable of 1 POST variation.
    
    NOTE:
        _*The weight of the POST variation can not be negative* in FLAM3H._
    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    Parametric variation parameters:
        #id: Limitations
    
    Each iterator has only one set of parametric variation parameters shared within the PRE, VAR and POST variations.
    This means if you use 2 PRE_Mobius, 4 Mobius and 1 POST_Mobius, they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters.
    
    
    
== Limitations: FF's PRE, VAR and POST variations ==

    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    FF PRE variations:
        #id: Limitations
    
    FF iterator is capable of 1 PRE variation.
    
    NOTE:
        _*The weight of the FF PRE variations can not be negative* in FLAM3H._

    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    FF VAR variations:
        #id: Limitations
    
    FF iterator is capable of 2 variations.
    
    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    FF POST variations:
        #id: Limitations
    
    FF iterator is capable of 2 POST variations.
    
    NOTE:
        _*The weight of the FF POST variation can not be negative* in FLAM3H._
       
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
        
    FF Parametric variation parameters:
        #id: Limitations
    
    FF iterator has two sets of parametric variation parameters.
    One is shared with VAR variations.
    The second is shared within the PRE- and POST-variations.
    
    # If you use 2 Mobius in the FF VAR section, they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters from set one ( FF: VARS Tab ).
    # If you use 1 PRE_Mobius and 2 POST_Mobius they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters from set two ( FF: PP VARS Tab ).
    
== Limitations: FF Shader ==

:box:
    #display: rounded gray

    FF Shader:
        #id: Limitations
    
    This finalxform ( FF ) does not possess any color parameters in this implementation ( Chaotica style ).

    NOTE:
        _When saving a Flame out from Fractorium/Apophysis with a finalxform remember to set the Final xform color to:_
        - Color -> 0.0
        - Color Speed -> 0.0 ( _this is the most important_ )
        - Direct Color -> 1.0
        
        _This way, you won't add a color to the Flame that FLAM3H won't be able to match._
