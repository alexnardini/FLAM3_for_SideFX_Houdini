[Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg]  *Preface*:

The inception of this [implementation|Wp:Implementation] dates back to 2020, during [COVID-19|Wp:COVID-19]. 
At first, it was just a straightforward point wrangle exercise to experiment with some of the formulas from the fractal Flame algorithm.
I didn't know much about the subject at the time, but as I began experimenting with some of the free and [open-source|Wp:Open_source] fractal Flame editors like Apophysis and Fractorium, I grew to love the field and gradually persuaded myself that I could port the entire [algorithm|Wp:Algorithm] and functionalities using Houdini out of the box.
Undoubtedly, it required some time to comprehend everything completely, but as I was also learning how to create fractal art, It slowly shaped into the proper form.

Specifically built to work in tandem with [Fractorium|http://fractorium.com],<br /> 
FLAM3H(tm) attempts to absorb as much informations as possible about its capabilities and incorporates all it can into its own toolkit.

These days, FLAM3H(tm) has all the features found in other third-party programs, plus a bunch more exclusive to this implementation.

Additionally, when combined with Houdini's [procedural|Wp:Procedural_generation] paradigm and toolsets, fractal Flames reach previously unheard-of levels of possibilities.

@intro

[Largeicon:opdef:.?iconSVG.svg]

_Individuals and fractal Flames are alike_.<br />
_Each one has its own personality, having gone through their own unique set of events that have helped shape who they are today._<br /><br />
_Consider the various formulas that make up fractal Flames as different brushes or life event brushes._<br />
_Each of these events can be identified by their patterns of_ [self-similarity|Wp:Self-similarity] _; while some have a bigger influence on the final forms and colors than others, all of them contribute to the composition as a whole._<br /><br />
_This is akin to a person's genome, or DNA._<br />
_Together, all of these variables contribute to the interesting nature of the fractal Flame discipline,_<br />
_with its seemingly endless possibilities, effects, and patterns._

<br />
[Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *FLAM3H(tm) - what is it ?*

FLAM3H(tm) as the name suggests, is the implementation of "the fractal Flame algorithm" inside SideFX Houdini.<br />
There have been different revisions of the same algorithm in the past years, this is the implementation of FLAM3.

Fractal art is not easy at all in the beginning.<br />
For this reason, it is suggested that you possess prior experience with this art form, may that be with Apophysis, Fractorium or really any other fractal Flame editor out there. This implementation was influenced by Apophysis, particularly in the fast/quick workflow design, but it has been biased in its underlying code toward Fractorium.

There is a very large, kind, and talented community out there that you can tap into and gather lots of information from to learn how to do fractal art.

Generally speaking and based on my own learning experiences,<br />
FLAM3H(tm) can complete every tutorial you can find for any of the existing fractal Flame editors out there.<br />
The majority of tutorials you can find are for Apophysis, the first program to use the algorithm with a [graphical user interface|Wp:Graphical_user_interface]. It rose to prominence as the most widely used fractal Flame editor and will always occupy a special place in the fractal art history.

_Here a few at hand_:

_*[DevianArt - Apophysis tutorial: Splits Elliptic|https://www.deviantart.com/satania/art/Tutorial-Splits-elliptic-150422119]*_

_*[DevianArt - Apophysis tutorial: Spherical bubbles|https://www.deviantart.com/fiery-fire/art/Apo-Tuto-Spherical-Bubbles-127911026]*_

_*[DevianArt - Apophysis tutorial: Bipolar shapes|https://www.deviantart.com/satania/art/Tutorial-Bipolar-Shapes-213391274]*_

_*[DevianArt - Apophysis tutorial: Double wedge|https://www.deviantart.com/teundenouden/art/Double-Wedge-Tutorial-810709969]*_

_*[DevianArt - Apophysis tutorial: Hemispherical|https://www.deviantart.com/c-91/art/Hemispherical-Apophysis-Tutorial-663954258]*_


A considerable amount of effort has been allocated to ensure that,<br />
assuming that the same variations are utilized within FLAM3H(tm) and that they remain within its limitations, a one-to-one match result is consistently obtained.

Being inside Houdini has its advantages,<br />
just think of the possibilities of utilizing his procedural paradigm and tool sets to animate your fractal Flames. It also makes it very easy to build a [pipeline|Wp:Pipeline_(computing)] around this tool using Houdini’s Python HOM libraries.

@Platforms

:platform:Windows
    This HDA and all its Python code have been extensively tested on Windows.

    
_The following platforms should function flawlessly, though I didn't get a chance to test every feature, so some may not function as intended._

@parameters FLAM3H(tm) Tabs parameters

== Before you start == (BEFORESTART)

_Third-party applications use an_ [orthogonal|Wp:Orthographic_projection] _type of viewer in their editors_.<br />
_If you'd like to get close to a fractal Flame editor vibe, set the_ [viewport|Wp:Viewport] _to_: *Front* (_or press the key ((3)) while the cursor is on any viewport_). _Once you have done that, you can also go to the FLAM3H(tm) preferences' tab and set the viewport color to: *Dark* (if not already)_.

_Best would be to use one of the Desktop files provided (HD or 4K) as they set everything up for you_.

_At the moment of this writing (up to H21)_:<br />
_It is suggested to go to the Houdini: *`Edit`*->*`Preferences`*->*`3Dviewport`* and set the Renderer to_ [OpenGL|Wp:OpenGL] _as it provide a better points visualization in the viewport when millions of them are displayed and/or their viewport point size is smaller than *`1`*(one). Changing the viewer renderer will require a restart of Houdini_.

    Here, you will define the quality of the fractal Flame algorithm solution.

:box:

    == GLOBAL: Iterations == (GLBITERATIONS)

iterations [Icon:TOP/xmlinput]:
    #id: GLOBAL
    Number of [iterations|Wp:Iteration] to use.
    
    You must experiment with the number of iterations and always go as low as possible to save on execution time.
    You went too low when the fractal Flame start to turn *_blocky_*, which happens when it crosses its own minimum.
    
    It is advised that occasionally you bump up this number a little to see if there is anything you are overlooking.
    For instance, certain Flames can seem completely different with higher number of iterations.
    
    _Generally speaking, for many fratcal Flames shapes_:
    
    - You do not need many iterations to get some good fractal Flames going, between *`10`* and *`24`* is usually more than you need while keeping execution speed acceptable.
    - If you increase the iterator Weight, use xaos to build containers, or use some kind of variation, you will require a higher number to resolve and show you the proper result.
    
    Almost all the fractal Flame images showcased inside FLAM3H(tm) Instagram account and website
    use a maximum of *`64`* iterations, with a few exceptions reaching *`96`* and, in rare cases, *`128`*/*`256`* and more.
    
    Some Flames require a truly high number of iterations to resolve properly.
    
    However,<br />
    you can create some beautiful fractal Flames with just a few iterations. Below are some examples:
    
    _*[Knot clusters: 6 iterations|https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/42110232/270743580-f3c891ed-21c6-474e-89fa-62020149d821.jpg]*_
    
    _*[Dancing stars: 12 iterations|https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/42110232/270014121-b68b27d9-ebb7-4580-ad5f-9d114f2585f7.jpg]*_
    <br /><br />

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        When: " *add iterations to Flame name* " toggle is *`On`* inside the OUT tab,
        changing the iterations' parameter will update the Flame name, if any have been typed.

    == GLOBAL: Density presets == (GLBDENSITY)

    
menu density presets [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu]:
    #id: GLOBAL
    Will allow you to select a density value quickly from some presets.

    Density here stand for: _*number of points to use*_.<br />
    For high-quality fractals, start from *`25M`*(_millions_) up to *`500M`*(_millions_) and more, depending on the type of fractal Flame you end up with.<br />

    As a general rule, the more, the better.<br />
    Must strike a balance between processing speed and quality.

    _The menu labels posses a bookmark icon_:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarWhiteSVG.svg] default preset of *`500k`*(_thousands_). This is what should be used while editing fractal Flames most of the time.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapCyanSmallSVG.svg] presets from *`1`* to *`15`* millions.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionEnabledMidSVG.svg] presets from *`25`* to *`250`* millions.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarRedHighSVG.svg] presets from *`500`* millions to *`1 Billion`*.

    <br />
    When using a custom density value from inside the preferences density tab,<br />
    if the choosen value is not present in this global menu entries, this menu label will become empty to signal the use of a custom density value.

    _Additionally,_<br />
    _some of the bookmark icons will signal the density values the xforms handles VIZ mode will keep being active, like the following_:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarWhiteXFVIZOFFSVG.svg] 
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapCyanSmallXFVIZOFFSVG.svg]

    _or when the xforms handles VIZ mode is ON_:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarWhiteXFVIZSVG.svg]
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapCyanSmallXFVIZSVG.svg]

    _or when the xforms handles VIZ is in SOLO mode_:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarWhiteXFVIZSOLOSVG.svg]
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapCyanSmallXFVIZSOLOSVG.svg]

    Beyound those bookmark icons,<br />
    the xforms handles VIZ mode will be automatically disabled.

    <br />

    
Reset density:
    #id: Global
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarWhiteSVG.svg]
    
    ((LMB)) to reset density to its default: *`500k`*(_thousands_)<br />
    This is what should be used while editing fractal Flames most of the time.

    <br />
    _Following are lower tier density presets you can set if you desire:_

    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) set density to: *`300k`*(_thousands_)
    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) set density to: *`200k`*(_thousands_)
    - ((ALT)) + ((LMB)) set density to: *`100k`*(_thousands_)

mini-menu Select Iterator [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu]:
    #id: SYS

    A quick shortcut mini-menu to quickly change focus to a desired multi-parameter's tab number. The menu entries are populated using each iterator’s note/name.

    This feature is useful when creating many iterators for the fractal Flame you are working on and to quickly review their state.

    When any iterator has its xform handle in SOLO mode already ([Icon:opdef:.?icon_xfHandlesEnabledMPIDXSVG.svg]),<br />
    it causes the iterator that is picked from this mini-menu to be automatically configured to be in SOLO mode. This enables you to swiftly go over each one automatically.

    _The bookmark icon will display the status of each iterator_:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarYellowOrangeSVG.svg] when an iterator is *`On`*/Active (_Default_).
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionDisabledZeroIterSVG.svg] when an iterator is *`On`*/Active and *`0`*(Zero) Weight.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapRedCopyPasteZeroWSVG.svg] when an iterator is *`On`*/Active, *`0`*(Zero) Weight and Marked.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapRedCopyPasteSVG.svg] when an iterator is *`On`*/Active and Marked.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionDisabledSVG.svg] when an iterator is *`Off`*/Disabled.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionDisabledSelIterSVG.svg] when an iterator is *`Off`*/Disabled and Marked.

    <br />
    When an iterator shader's opacity is set to *`0`*(Zero),<br />
    its menu label will be prefixed with the message string: *`[ZERO opacity]`*<br />
    This is handy also when you load or build a Flame that uses containers so to easily spot the intermediary iterators used in the construction.

    _Additionally,_<br />
    _when there are *`0`*(Zero) iterators, an info message is displayed instead_:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] when there are zero iterators.
    <br /><br />
    
    NOTE:
        This feature is not working over the Network Editor's Parameter Dialog displayed when pressing the ((p)) key. Please, open a Parameter Editor in its own pane tab or floating panel for this feature to work.

    <br />

FF [Icon:TOP/xmlinput] [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: SYS
    *`Off`* by default.

    <br />
    
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionFFDisabledSVG.svg] when FF is *`Off`*/Disabled (_Default_).
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionFFEnabledSVG.svg] when FF is *`On`*/Active.
    
    Enable or disable the [finalXform|#FF](_FF_).

    This is being introduced since it is convenient to switch the finalXform(_FF_) *`On`* or *`Off`* without constantly entering the FF tab.

    <br />
    
    
RIP [Icon:TOP/xmlinput] [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: SYS
    *`Off`* by default.

    <br />
    
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionRIPDisabledSVG.svg] when RIP is *`Off`*/Disabled (_Default_).
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionRIPEnabledSVG.svg] when RIP is *`On`*/Active.
    
    Remove invalid points. *INF*, *NAN*, *Zero Opacity* and *out-of-bounds* points.

    - After the algorithm transforms the points, it is possible for some of those points to shoot to infinity. Turn this *`On`* to get rid of those points.
    - When an iterator's opacity is *`0`*(Zero), you can turn this option *`On`* to get rid of those points since *opacity* == *`@pscale`* ( *`@widths`* _in Solaris_ ) you do not need them anymore.
    - If rendering a Flame seems unusually slow, it's probably because certain points wind up being really far from the Zero world. Those points will be eliminated if this option is turned *`On`*.
    <br /><br />

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        When loading hip files FLAM3H(tm) will check if any of the iterators have their shader opacity set to *`0`*(Zero) and if so, it will switch this toggle *`On`*.<br />

        
F3C [Icon:TOP/xmlinput] [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: SYS
    *`On`* by default.

    <br />

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionF3CEnabledSVG.svg] *Checked*: use the Flam3/Apophysis behavior (_Default_).
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionF3CDisabledSVG.svg] *Unchecked*: use the Chaotica behavior.
    <br /><br />

    Flam3 compatibility.

    The behavior of the *`Cos`*, *`Cosh`*, *`Cot`*, *`Coth`*, *`Csc`*, *`Csch`*, *`Sec`*, *`Sech`*, *`Sin`*, *`Sinh`*, *`Tan`* and *`Tanh`* variations are different in Flam3/Apophysis versus Chaotica.
    
    These variations are also referred to as: *trigonometric variations*.<br />

    In a fractal Flame,<br />
    each point's position is updated by applying a variation (_a mathemathical transform_). Trigonometric variations are simply those based on the standard [trigonometric functions|Wp:Trigonometric_functions] (_and their_ [hyperbolic|Wp:Hyperbolic_functions] _counterparts_).

    _For example_:
    - *`Cos`* */* *`Cosh`* *variations*: apply cosine or hyperbolic cosine functions.
    - *`Tan`* */* *`Tanh`* *variations*: apply tangent or hyperbolic tangent functions.
    - *`Sec`* */* *`Sech`* *variations*: apply secant or hyperbolic secant functions.

    == SYS: xforms handles VIZ == (SYSXFVIZ)

    When reviewing and editing your fractal Flame, the viewport xforms handles provide excellent visual feedback. 
    They will assist you in modifying each iterator (_or FF_) and rapidly help you comprehend the currently existing setup.


xforms handles VIZ [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: SYS
    *`Off`* by default.
    
    <br />

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_xfHandlesDisabledSVG.svg] vieport xforms VIZ is *`Off`*/Disabled (_Default_).
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_xfHandlesEnabledSVG.svg] vieport xforms VIZ is *`On`*/Active.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_xfHandlesEnabledMPIDXSVG.svg] one of the iterators/xforms is in SOLO mode.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_ffHandlesEnabledSVG.svg] the FF is in SOLO mode.

    The xforms handles will be shown in the viewport when it is turned *`On`*.<br />
    Xform handles are a visual representation of the affine (PRE or POST) values.<br />
    
    Since they are designed to contribute as little as possible to the calculation, you may really leave them turned *`On`* at all times, until rendering is required.

    In the preferences' tab under *`prefs viewport`* you can set the thickness of the xforms handles curves using the parameter: *`wire width`*.

    Since *`wire width`* parameter is setting a global attribute linked to every viewer in the active Houdini session, FLAM3H(tm) will save this information when this mode is activated and restore it when the mode is terminated, provided that no other FLAM3H(tm) node in the scene has this mode enabled. If not, it will maintain the current settings.

    Once this mode is active,<br />
    from each iterator's tab you will be able to display an iterator of your choice in SOLO mode (_display only the viewport xform handle for the selected iterator, and nothing else_).

    [Image:opdef:.?FLAM3H_DOC_xforms_handles.svg]
    
    _These handles are not editable, but only for visualization purpose_.<br />
    _They will be helpful to better grasp how the affine values (PRE and POST affine) are acting over each iterator(or FF) of the fractal Flame_.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tips*<br />
    - Depending on its multi-parameter index number, each accessible iterator will produce an xform handle with a color, but the FF(_finalXform_) will always be grey/white and shown on top of the others to make it easy to identify when it is active.

    - The *`RED`* and *`GREEN`* central axes represent respectively the *`X`* and *`Y`* axis as a frame of reference. Their triangular form will make it easier to see the scale in one or both dimensions.

    - When an iterator(_or FF_) POST affine is active, its xform' handle will turn dashed and an extra knot created to represent its POST affine' pivot/offset (_like in the red dashed handle in the above illustration_).

    - The viewport handles will be automatically disabled if the FLAM3H(tm) density value is raised above *`5M`*(_millions_) points.

    - The viewport handles will be automatically disabled when FLAM3H(tm) is in camera sensor VIZ mode.

    - The viewport handles will be automatically disabled when FLAM3H(tm) is run from whithin the Solaris/Lop context.

    - The FLAM3H(tm) node posses a dive-in location to only display the xforms handles without the FLAM3H(tm) points.<br />

        - double ((LMB)) on the FLAM3H(tm) node to dive-in, or:

        _With the FLAM3H(tm) node selected_:
        - press the key: ((i)) to dive-in

        _Once you are in_:
        - press the key: ((u)) to dive-out
    
        Those shortcut keys work when the mouse cursor is over the network editor as well over the viewport (_and over the parameters pane too_).
        To dive-in is useful to identify them visually as sometime it can be difficult to spot them when the fractal Flame is present.

    - To exclusively output the xforms handles, a second output has been introduced to the FLAM3H(tm) node.
    Since they are not baked into the point cloud, you may safely render the fractal Flame while switching between SOP and LOP, which makes it useful for viz purposes.
    
    <br /><br />
    [Icon:NETWORKS/sop] *Context aware*<br />
    - Xforms handles viz are context aware, and you will be able to activate them only if a Sop viewer is available.

    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *From Fractorium help page*

    Xforms have the most effect over the look of the final output image. Discussing every possible technique for using them is beyond the scope of this project. For such information, you should follow the numerous Apophysis tutorials that are available on Deviant Art and elsewhere. This article is limited to some basic performance considerations when using xforms.

    The number of xforms does not affect performance because only one is chosen to be applied on each iteration. Choosing a random xform among 5 takes the same amount of time as choosing among 50. However, the number of variations in each xform does affect performance.

    Adding a post affine transform to an xform will also affect performance since it’s an additional affine that must be applied each time the xform is selected. Applying an affine is very simple so the performance impact shouldn’t be too noticeable.
    <br /><br />

    _The following control icons are provided_:

    - [Largeicon:BUTTONS/add] to add a new iterator at the end of the existing set of iterators.
    - [Largeicon:BUTTONS/minus] to reduce the number of iterators by *`1`*(one). It will remove one from the end.

    NOTE:
        The order of the iterators does not matter at all.

        Based on each iterator's Weight and combined with their xaos settings, the algorithm will select and execute them based on your logic.

        For this reason, it is suggested to create them one after the other, sequentially.

    <br /><br />

    NOTE:
        The text you write here will be stored with the Flame preset file on Save and also shown inside third-party applications like Apophysis and Fractorium as the iterator's name.

copy/paste:

    [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapRedCopyPasteSVG.svg]

    All the necessary methods for copy/paste iterator's data are contained in this icon.
    
    Using this icon, you can mark an iterator for copying, and then transfer the data from the marked iterator into another iterator number, even if it's within a different FLAM3H(tm) node.

    When you paste the data, it wil copy everything from the marked iterator but not xaos.
    
    Once an iterator has been marked, you can use the mini-menu [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu] next to the icon to copy individual sections from the marked iterator, including xaos.
    
    Every item in the mini-menu [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu] is named exactly like every folder an iterator posses.<br />
    The sections items in the mini-menu have a bookmark icon that change based on the marked iterator status:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapRedCopyPasteEntrieSVG.svg] when the marked iterator is *`On`*/Active.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapRedCopyPasteZeroWSVG.svg] when the marked iterator is *`On`*/Active and *`0`*(Zero) Weight.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionDisabledSelIterSVG.svg] when the marked iterator is *`Off`*/Disabled.

    <br />
    When you mark an iterator, you establish a live connection with it and the data will be copied from it only when you ((ALT)) + ((LMB)) from inside another iterator either on the same FLAM3H(tm) node or on a different one.
    This way you can keep the iterator marked while working and paste again its data somewhere else after making additional changes to its contents.

    _Usage_:
    
    - ((LMB)) to mark this iterator for being copied. If already marked, it will unmark it.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) to unmark this FLAM3H(tm) node marked iterator for being copied.
    - ((ALT)) + ((LMB)) to copy the values from the marked iterator into this iterator.
    
    _Additionally_:
    
    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) to reset this iterator to its default values.

    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tips*<br />
    - When an iterator is marked for being copied, a node note with the marked iterator number is being displayed in the network editor.<br />
    - When copy/paste post affines, they will be automatically turned *`Off`* if they are default values to save on computation.
    - A custom user data is added to the FLAM3H(tm) node with the iterator number being marked; the data name is: *`Marked iterator`*.<br /><br />This is handy because you can review the user data from the node *`info window`* ( ((MMB)) _on the node_ ) and quickly find out which one is being marked.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tips*<br /> 
    - Every time you activate the xform handle VIZ SOLO mode for an iterator, a custom user data is added to the FLAM3H(tm) node with the iterator number being in SOLO mode; the data name is: *`XF VIZ`*.<br />This is handy because you can review the user data from the node *`info window`* ( ((MMB)) _on the node_ ) and quickly find out which one is being displayed (_in case you do not remember or when many iterators have been created_).

    The Weight of this iterator.<br />
    
    Calculate the likelihood that this iterator will be selected during the [Chaos game|Wp:Chaos_game]. You may require more iterations to correctly resolve the shapes of the fractal Flame you are working on if an iterator Weight is higher than the others.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tip*

    An iterator (_aka: xform or transform_) is one of the rules that moves points around in a fractal Flame. Every time the algorithm runs an iteration, it randomly picks one iterator to apply to the point.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *What does the Weight do ?*

    The Weight controls the [probability|Wp:Probability] that an iterator will be chosen.
    - Higher Weight → higher chance of being picked
    - Lower Weight → lower chance
    - Weight = *`0`*(Zero) → never picked

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Why is this important ?*

    The probability of picking an iterator decides how often its pattern appears in the final image:
    - A big Weight means that iterator dominates the fractal.
    - A small Weight means it only adds subtle details.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *In short*
    - Weights = the lottery tickets each iterator gets in the Chaos game.<br />More tickets = more chances to be picked.

    == Iterator: Xaos == (FLAMEITERXAOS)

    #id: FLAME
    
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *From Fractorium help page*
    
    _What is xaos ?_
    
    Xaos provides more fine-grained control over the selection of xforms on each iteration.
    It is expressed as a probability modifier for each xform in relation to every other xform.

    The default state is for all elements to have a value of *`1`*(one), which means that xaos is not used.
    When any element is changed to something other than *`1`*(one), xaos is in effect.

    Xaos specifies how likely a xform is to be chosen based on the previous xform that was chosen.
    Alternatively, this can also be expressed as the probability modifier of the next chosen xform based on the currently chosen one.
    These two methods of stating xaos are known as “from” and “to”.
    
    [Image:opdef:.?FLAM3H_DOC_xaos_pathsSVG.svg]
    _The above image shows five iterators with one variation each and how they are connected to each other through a hypothetical xaos setting._
    
    The default mode is xaos TO. You can change it to use xaos FROM mode instead in the preferences tab.
    
    Xaos TO and xaos FROM are at their core each other's reflections. This means they are the same data, but one is the transpose of the other.
    
    A [matrix transpose|Wp:Transpose] is a matrix flipped along its diagonal. Think of it as looking at the same matrix from 2 opposite points of view.
    
    _Looking from an iterator's point of view_:
    - When in *`xaos TO`* mode, you will think: *to* wich iterator am I allowed to send the points I just executed?
    - When in *`xaos FROM`* mode, you will think: *from* wich iterator am I allowed to receive points before I execute them myself?
    - Note that the same concept applies also to the iterator itself, this means the question will be: can I execute a point after I already executed it myself? (_like the yellow iterator with the_ *`Curl`* _variation in the above diagram/image._)
    
    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *How to set xaos in FLAM3H(tm) *
        
    - To set xaos for a Flame with *`4`*(four) iterators, use the "*`xaos:`*" keyword followed by each iterator's Weight values separated by a colon: *`xaos:`* *1:2:3:4*.
    - When the auto space xaos weights option is *`On`*/Active ( it is by default ), the xaos keyword will look like this: "*`xaos :`*". The important information here is that you always need a colon "*:*" after the word "*xaos*" to make it work, as in: " *`xaos:`* ".
    - If no set or when using a short descriptive note, FLAM3H(tm) will assume all xaos values are *`1`*(one), the equivalent of: *`xaos:`* *1:1:1:1*
    - If you set only *iterator 1* and *iterator 2*, FLAM3H(tm) will always fill in the rest with a value of *`1`*(one). As an example: *`xaos:`* *0:0* will be interpreted as *`xaos:`* *0:0:1:1*
    - When turning iterators *`On`* and *`Off`* and removing or adding them, FLAM3H(tm) will internally remove and reformat xaos values to account for missing iterators. It is fully automatic.
    
    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Xaos command options*
    
    - If you type a non-numeric character in any of the xaos's weights, FLAM3H(tm) will undo to what you had before.
    - If you dnt use the "*`xaos:`*" keywork at the beginning of the string, the entire xaos string will be reset to all weights with value: *`1`*(one)
    - If you just type a number, the entire xaos string will be reset to all weights set to that number.
    - If you type a negative number, it will be reset to a value of:  *`1`*(one)

        It may occur that the coloration you see when loading Flame presets differs from that found in Fractorium or Apophysis.<br />
        This is because extra iterations are required to correctly spread the colors, even when the fractal Flame forms match.

        _Increase the number of iterations until the coloration matches the ones found in Apophysis, Fractorium, and others_.

        [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *From Fractorium help page*

        While traditional iterated function systems used only linear affine transforms for each iterator/xform application, flam3 extended this design by adding the ability to use almost any mathematical calculation as well. Flam3 dubbed these new math functions as “variations” which is a catch-all name for an arbitrary math function.

        Variations have a great affect on performance so it’s important to use them sparingly. The reason is that when an iterator/xform is selected to be applied, every variation within it must be applied as well. Do not add numerous variations that have little to no affect on the final output image. Instead, only use ones which you can verify have an effect you desire.

        Since variations can be just about anything, they behave in many different ways.

        At a bare minimum, all variations have a weight and most of them use it. You can examine the effect of the weight [parameter|Wp:Parameter_(computer_programming)] by adjusting it and seeing how it affects the final output image.

        In addition to weight, most variations have additional parameters that can be adjusted.

        Most use the outputs of the pre affine transforms as input points which are then modified via various calculations. However, some do not use the pre affine points at all. For these, you will notice that dragging the pre affine transforms around has no effect on the final output image.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *From Fractorium help page*

    When applying an iterator (_aka: xform or transform_) to an input point, variations are traditionally applied in between the pre affine and post affine transforms.

    As the algorithm evolved over time, users realized it would be useful to be able to apply one or more variations in between the output of the pre affine transform and the application of the first *`VAR`* variation. These are known as *`PRE`* variations. They differ from regular *`VAR`* variations in that their outputs are usually assigned rather than summed. This has the effect of making an adjustment to the point before it’s used as inputs to all of the regular *`VAR`* variations.

    If multiple *`PRE`* variations are used, their outputs are not summed, they are assigned. It is for this reason that order matters for them.

    In practice,<br />
    *`PRE`* and *`POST`* variations are used to achieve a specific effect and are therefore most useful when only one of each is used. Multiple *`PRE`* and *`POST`* variations rarely produce desirable or controllable effects.
    
    <br />

    There are *`4`*(four) *`VAR`* variations available. The order to whitch you apply them do not matter as they are additive/cumulative.

    - If you have a *`Linear`* variation in *slot 1*, and you add a *`Spherical`* variation in *slot 2*, the *`Spherical`* variation will add its effect(proportional to its weight) to the result coming from the *`Linear`* variation in *slot 1*, and so on for the other available slots.<br />
    - If you do the opposite, a *`Spherical`* variation in *slot 1* and a *`Linear`* in *slot 2*, the result will be identical assuming both retain the same weight values.
    * When using parametric variations, their parameters will populate the *VARS* tab.

    TIP:

    <br /><br />

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        
        In order to lower the cost of the computation, it is preferable to set a variation weight to *`0`*(Zero) rather than retaining it at extremely low values if their impact is negligible.
        
        The variation will be fully disregarded when its weight is *`0`*(Zero).

    Every time you either input a value, drag the slider or use the ((mouse_wheel)), the Scale value will reset back to the default value of: *`1`* (100% -> no scale)

    _When using the_ ((mouse_wheel)):
    - ((mouse_wheel)) will scale the value by an increment of: `+/-` *`0.1`*
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((mouse_wheel)) will scale the value by an increment of: `+/-` *`0.01`*

    Affine transformation coefficients for the current iterator(_xform_).
    <br /><br />

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        A linear transformation cannot be used to translate a set of points. 
        
        To translate a set of points, we need to use an [Affine transformations|Wp:Affine_transformation]. 

        An affine transformation multiplies a vector by a matrix, just as in a linear transformation, 
        and then adds a vector to the result ( the *`O`*._`xy`_ component ). 

        This added *`vector2`* carries out the translation. 

        By applying an affine transformation to an image on the screen, we can do everything a linear transformation can do, 
        and also have the ability to move the image up or down and left or right.

    <br />

    A 2D affine transformation is just a fancy way of saying:
    - "_Take some points in 2D space and move, rotate, flip, stretch, or shear them, while keeping straight lines straight_."

    It's like applying a mathematical "filter" that changes the position and orientation of things, but *doesn't bend or curve them*.

    Fractal Flames are created using an Iterated Funtion System (*IFS*). This mean:
    - You have a set of functions.
    - You repeatedly apply one of them to a point.
    - Over time, the points create a fractal pattern.

    Each funtion in the IFS usually has two parts:
    # An affine transformation (_linear part + translation_).
    # A non-linear variation (_curvy distortions, like Swirl, Spherical, Horseshoe_)

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Why is it important ?*
    - The affine transform determine *where in the plane* the next variation happens.
    - It define the *basic skeleton* of the fractal.
    - If you only used non linear variations without affine transforms, everything would cluster around the origin. You'd loose structure.

    <br />

    Each iterator(_xform_) has an affine transform that is always applied on every iteration.
    This is known as the pre affine becasue it is applied before the variations. There is also an optional affine applied after the variations known as the post affine.

    For speed purpose, only the very basic parameters of the affine are provided, plus a Scale and Rotation parameters to make life easier. Below a basic guideline on how to use the affine parameters:

    - With *`X`*._`xy`_ and *`Y`*._`xy`_ you will apply rotation and scale/shear while with *`O`*._`xy`_ you will apply translation/offset.
    - They compose a 2x3 matrix ( *`X`*._`xy`_, *`Y`*._`xy`_, *`O`*._`xy`_ ).
    - The rotation parameter will take the values of *`X`*._`xy`_, *`Y`*._`xy`_, *`O`*._`xy`_ and rotate them ( *`O`*._`xy`_ _being the pivot_).
    
    There are two ways you can use the affine:
    # Use *`X`*._`xy`_, *`Y`*._`xy`_, *`O`*._`xy`_ for everything (_translation, rotation and scale/shear_).
    
    # Use the Rotation parameter in combination with the Scale parameter and the *`X`*.`xy` and *`Y`*.`xy` for tweaks on shear and *`O`*._`xy`_ for translation.

    Rotate affine values in angle degrees.<br />The rotation will take the values of *`X`*, *`Y`*, *`O`* and apply a rotation.<br />(_With *`O`* being the pivot_).

    NOTE:
        The resulting affine coefficients are not updated in the UI but passed directly internally to the algorithm.

    == Iterator: Post Affine == (FLAMEITERPOSTAFFINE)
        
post affine [Icon:TOP/xmlinput]:
    #id: FLAME

    The term "post-affine" would be used to emphasize the sequential application of an affine transformation within a larger pipeline of operations.

    For example, if you first apply a perspective transformation to an image and then apply an affine transformation to correct for a slight remaining distortion or to further refine the image, you might refer to the latter as a "post-affine transformation" to distinguish its place in the sequence. 

    In the context of fractal Flames, the "post-affine transformation" will be the very last to be applied to the incoming point/sample.

    [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapRedCopyPasteFFSVG.svg]

    All the necessary methods for copy/paste FF's data are contained in this icon.
    
    This icon allows you to mark a FLAM3H(tm) node's FF for being copied, and then copy the data from the marked FF into a separate FLAM3H(tm) node.

    Once the FF has been marked, you can use the mini-menu [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu] next to the icon to copy individual sections from the marked FF.
    
    Every item in the mini-menu [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu] is named exactly like every folder the FF iterator posses.<br />
    The sections items in the mini-menu have a bookmark icon that change based on the marked FF status:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapRedCopyPasteEntrieFFSVG.svg] when the marked FF is *`On`*/Active.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_StarSwapRedCopyPasteEntrieFFOffSVG.svg] when the marked FF is *`Off`*/Disabled.
    
    <br />
    When you mark an FF, you establish a live connection with it and the data will be copied from it only when you ((ALT)) + ((LMB)) from inside another FLAM3H(tm) node' FF.
    This way you can keep the FF marked while working and paste again its data somewhere else after making additional changes to its contents.

    _Usage_:
    
    - ((LMB)) to mark this FF for being copied. If already marked, it will unmark it.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) to unmark this FF for being copied.
    - ((ALT)) + ((LMB)) to copy the values from the marked FLAM3H(tm) node's FF into this FLAM3H(tm) node's FF.
    
    _Additionally_:
    
    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) to reset this FF to its default values.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tips*<br />
    - When the FF is marked for being copied, a node note with the text "*FF*" is being displayed in the network editor.<br />
    - When copy/paste post affines, they will be automatically turned *`Off`* if they are default values to save on computation.
    - A custom user data is added to the FLAM3H(tm) node signaling the FF being marked; the data name is: *`Marked FF`*.<br /><br />This is handy because you can review the user data from the node *`info window`* ( ((MMB)) _on the node_ ) and quickly find out if the FF is being marked.

    - If you have a *`Linear`* variation in *slot 1*, and you add a *`Spherical`* variation in *slot 2*, the *`Spherical`* variation will add its effect(proportional to its weight) to the result coming from the *`Linear`* variation in *slot 1*, and so on for the other available slots.<br />
    - If you do the opposite, a *`Spherical`* variation in *slot 1* and a *`Linear`* in *slot 2*, the result will be identical assuming both retain the same weight values.

    Hue, Saturation and Value of the palette's colors.
    
    [HSV|Wp:HSL_and_HSV] values are exported into the palette preset on save <br />
    and also into the XML on Flame save when they are used.

    <br />

HSV keep values on Load [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: PALETTE
    *`Off`* by default.
    
    When loading a palette, FLAM3H(tm) will either set the HSV values to the one stored into the loaded palette preset, or reset them to their defaults otherwise.
    
    Check this option to keep the current HSV values unchanged after loading a palette preset.

    <br />

HSV palette [Icon:DATATYPES/ramp]:

    *It is meant for preview only and you can not edit this palette*.
    
    When changing the HSV values from their defaults, this palette will preview the output of the final color corrected palette.

    _The palette parameter come with the following tool icon_: <br />

    [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarWhiteSVG.svg] <br />
    - ((LMB)) to updated the HSV color correction in case it was not already.
    
menu lookup samples  [Icon:TOP/xmlinput] [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu]:
    #id: PALETTE
    
    The amount of lookup samples to use to sample this palette.

    _Some of the menu labels posses a bookmark icon_:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarWhiteSVG.svg] mark the default preset, *`256`* samples.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionEnabledSVG.svg] indicate a medium preset, *`512`* samples.
    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarRedHighSVG.svg] indicate a more computational expensive preset, *`1024`* samples.
    
    <br />
    Lookup samples have no connection on the palette you design. Only a few color keys can be made;
    nevertheless, the palette will be internally sampled (_linearly spaced_) from *`0`*(Zero: _start_) to *`1`*(one: _end_) using this amount of samples.
    
    The amount of linearly spaced color keys in a typical fractal Flame is equivalent to *`256`*, which is the default.
    
    However,<br />
    if you create a palette with more than *`256`* color keys you might eventually want to use an higher amount of samples to be sure to catch all the subtle color variations of the palette.
    
    In general, *`256`* lookup samples will always be good.
    <br /><br />

    NOTE:
        - Saving out a Flame into a file, will also save the palette lookup samples value so that you can restore it once you load the Flame back into FLAM3H(tm).
        - If you are loading a Flame file preset from another software or from older versions of FLAM3H(tm) without the lookup samples XML key in the file, the default value of *`256`* will be used instead.
        - Saving a Flame out will always save the palette with *`256`* color's keys. If you created a palette with more than *`256`* colors, for example with *`1024`* color keys and sample it with *`1024`* samples to take into account all the subtle color changes, turn *`On`* the *PREFS options* tab toggle -> *`palette 256+`*.

    *MB:* _Flame fractal moton blur._
    
    When animating your fractal Flame, turning this on will compute a proper temporal motion blur (_centered_).

_This functionality is included to complete the implementation as presented in the original FLAM3 paper_.

    *`Off`* by default.

    Enable [motion blur|Wp:Motion_blur_(media)].

    Since nowadays the effect of motion blur is achieved most of the time as a separate post process step (_e.g. inside a_ [compositing|Wp:Digital_compositing] _application_) 
    this implementation adopted the use of a centered motion blur just for completeness, as explained in the official paper.<br /><br />

    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *From the fractal Flame algorithm official paper*:

    _Motion blur, or temporal anti-aliasing, is not so easy to do correctly_.<br />
    _Supersampling can be achieved by varying the parameters over time while running the Chaos game_. <br /><br />
    That is, if *`5M`*(_millions_) samples are used to draw the frame at time t, to instead use *`1M`* samples at time t-0.5, *`1M`* samples at t-0.25, *`1M`* at t, *`1M`* at t+0.25 and *`1M`* at t+0.5, all the while accumulating into the same buffer.

    _It may be possible that in the future a directional motion blur mode will be added to FLAM3H(tm), but for now there is no need to do so_.
    <br /><br />

    TIP:
        #display: orange

        - If you animate any of the available parameters using expressions, remember to always use *`@Time`* and not *`$F`* so FLAM3H(tm) will be able to interpolate through time properly.

Iterations on Load:
    #id: IN
    Set a number of iterations to use every time you load a Flame from a *.flame file.

    This will override the internal default value of *`64`* iterations.
    <br /><br />

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        If "add iterations to Flame name" OUT tab option is *`Off`*/Disabled:
    
        The iterations number you want your fractal Flame to use when you load it back into FLAM3H(tm) can be baked into the preset name you choose for it.

        For instance, the Flame preset "_*My_Awesome_GrandJulia*_" will be loaded with *`64`* iterations by default.

        However, all settings will be overridden if you add the iterations number to the preset name after a double colon (*`::`*), as in "_*My_Awesome_GrandJulia*_*`::16`*" and load it with an iterations count of *`16`*.
        
        Therefore, do some tests before saving it, and choose the ideal iterations number to incorporate into the preset name.
        
        If you like,<br />
        you can manually edit the created XML/Flame file and change the *flame-> "name"* key afterwards.

Force iterations on Load [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: IN
    *`Off`* by default.

    When Flame files are loaded,<br />
    FLAM3H(tm) immediately sets the iterations number to *`64`*, which seems like a reasonable amount to resolve the majority of them rather effectively.
    
    However,<br />
    if you need to act quickly, you can use this number to override the iterations set on load.

    If the iterations number is baked into the Flame preset name, it will override this setting.

    Turn *`On`* "override iterations from Flame name" toggle to override the iterations number baked into the Flame preset name.

F3H affine style (IN) [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: IN
    *`On`* by default.

    To be used when loading Flame presets that posses F3H affine style format in it.
    
    If no F3H affine style are found nothing will happen and FLAM3H(tm) will load the Flame preset using the standard affine style instead.
    
    F3H affine style format are useful when you rotate iterators using the Rot angle parameter and you still want to reload the Flame using the Rotation value instead of the affine transformed by that Rotation whitch can lead to values that are hard to edit once loaded.
    
    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *F3H affine style*<br />
    _Below is an example iterator at its default values rotated by 45 degrees inside FLAM3H_:

    *Y*: *`0.707107`*, *`0.707107`* <br />
    *O*: *`0`*, *`0`* 

    <br />
    When this option is *`On`*/Active (_it is by default_) and both version are present into the Flame preset you are trying to load, it will load the preset using the F3H version, when *`Off`* it will use the standard version.
    <br /><br />

    NOTE:
        *You need to reload the current Flame preset for this change to take place*.

        F3H affine style format are only available when you save a Flame preset out from FLAM3H(tm) using the OUT tab's option "F3H affine style" whitch is *`On`*/Active by default.

    All of the variations that Fractorium has but FLAM3H(tm) does not are known as: *`MISSING`*.

    FLAM3H(tm) was designed to work in tandem with Fractorium, and it makes an effort to learn as much as it can about everything that Fractorium is capable of, in this case, about all the variations he posses.

    All of the variations that Fractorium lacks will be classified as: *`UNKNOWN`*<br />
    and they will be searched inside the XML key: [Icon:TOP/xmlinput] *`plugins`* of the loaded Flame preset (_from file or from Clipboard_).

    <br />

    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *IN infos: Tips*<br />
    
    Every time you load a Flame preset either from a disk file or from the Clipboard the IN infos tab will show you informations about the loaded preset.

    All the displayed informations are gathered from the XML of the loaded Flame preset.

    The majority of FLAM3H(tm) user interface features, mostly buttons, have hidden techniques that assist in identifying whether a loaded Flame preset from a disk file has been altered. When it's happening, the IN infos will be updated and each of the following entries will be prefixed with an asterisk (*`*`*). You will need to reload the current preset if you desire to fully update.

    _The infos are categorized as follow_:
    
    - *`Software`*:<br />The software used to create/author the loaded Flame preset.
    - *`Name`*:<br />The name of the loaded Flame preset.
    - *`Palette count`*:<br />How many colors are in the palette of the loaded Flame preset and its color format.

    <br />

    - *`Iterators count`*:<br />Number of iterators/xforms used in the loaded Flame preset.
    - *`Post affine`*:<br />If any of the iterators/xforms post affine is being used it will say: *`YES`*, otherwise: *`NO`*.
    - *`Opacity`*:<br />If any of the iterators/xforms have its shader's opacity set to *`0`*(Zero) it will say: *`YES`*, otherwise: *`NO`*.
    - *`Xaos`*:<br />If xaos is being used it will say: *`YES`*, otherwise: *`NO`*.
    - *`FF`*:<br />If the FF(finalXform) is being used it will say: *`YES`*, otherwise: *`NO`*.
        - *`FF Post affine`*:<br />(_When the FF is ON_) If the FF post affine is being used it will say: *`YES`*, otherwise: *`NO`*.

    <br />

    - *`Variations used`*:<br />Number of unique variations being used and their names in alphatical order.

        _The following entries will appear when the loaded Flame preset use variations FLAM3H(tm) do not posses_:

    - *`MISSING`*:<br />Unique variations names being used FLAM3H(tm) do not posses but Fractorium does. 
    - *`UNKNOWN`*:<br />Unique variations names being used but neither FLAM3H(tm) or Fractorium posses. 

    <br />

    _Additionally_:

    - If the currenlty loaded Flame lib file is locked, the text *`-> LOCKED`* will appear in the very first line at the top.
    - Next and at the end of the *`Palette count`* info line, the text *`[HSV]`* will appear if the loaded Flame preset is using HSV values different from defaults.
    - Below the *`Palette count`* info line, the text *`CC`* will appear if the loaded Flame preset use color correction curves values different from default.
    - Below the *`Palette count`* info line (_and next to the *`CC`* if present_), the text *`MB`* will appear if the loaded Flame preset use motion blur.

    *OUT*: _Save *.flame file type to be loaded back inside Apophysis, Fractorium, FLAM3H(tm) and others._
 
    The OUT tab provides options to export your current fractal Flame work, preserving all necessary data for future editing, sharing or rendering. It ensures your creative progress is safely stored in standard format compatible with other Flame tools and rendering engines. It is a native Flame fractal file format containing transformation parameters, gradients, and rendering settings.
    
    A *.flame file is an XML-formatted type of file.<br />
    The Flame file format does not support animations, but only static frames, so to speak. If you animated your fractal Flame, save the hip file from Houdini instead.

TIP:
    #display: orange
    _FLAM3H(tm) allows you to save your Flames in the standard *.flame file format_
    _so that you can load them back inside any other applications like Fractorium, Apophysis and others._
    
    _You must abide by some rules imposed by the original Flame file format._
    
    _Not using multiple instances of the same variation in any of the accessible sections (*`PRE`*, *`VAR`*, or *`POST`*) is the most crucial thing to keep in mind._
    
    _For instance,_<br />
    _you cannot utilize *`2`*(two) *`Mobius`* variations inside an iterator's *`PRE`* or *`VAR`* sections._

    _But you can use_:
    - _*`1`*(one) *`Mobius`* in the *`PRE`*_
    - _*`1`*(one) *`Mobius`* in the *`VAR`*_
    - _*`1`*(one) *`Mobius`* in the *`POST`*_
    
    _FLAM3H(tm) by design, will allow you to be more flexible with your Flame construction choises and allow_
    _you to bend this rule, enabling the use of the same variation multiple times within the same section (Chaotica style), but you won't be able to save out_
    _the result in the standard Flame file format._

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        When you have finished creating a FLAM3H(tm) library, you can rename the file to begin with "*`F3H_LOCK`*" to prevent any future alterations.

        You can rename a lib file, for instance, called "_*my_grandJulia.flame*_" to "*`F3H_LOCK`*_*_my_grandJulia.flame*_" to keep it secure.

Save Flame:
    #id: OUT
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_WhiteStarSVG.svg]

    _Usage_:
    
    - ((LMB)) to save this Flame inside the selected OUT file, if any. If the selected file exists and already contains some Flames in it, it will append the current one.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) if not a valid filepath is present already it will open a file chooser, otherwise it will open the file explorer to the file location.
    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) to erase the content of the file and overwrite it with only this Flame.
    - ((ALT)) + ((LMB)) to copy this Flame into the Clipboard.

    _Additionally_:

    - If the selected file does not exist, it will be created.
    - If the selected file is not a valid Flame file type, nothing will happen.
    
    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Once you click save*:
    
    - If you select a location and a filename without an extension, it will automatically add the _*.flame*_ extension to them.
    - If you do not provide a file name at all, it will generate one for you based on today's date and current time, assuming you have a valid location selected.
    - If nothing is selected (_e.g. OUT file empty or invalid_), nothing will happen.
    
    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tip*:
    - When saving out Flame files, if you created a palette with more than *`256`* colors, for example with *`1024`* color keys and want to save them all to keep all the subtle color changes, turn *`On`* the *PREFS options* tab toggle -> *`palette 256+`*. 
    <br /><br />

    NOTE:
        Keep in mind that you can not utilize a variation more than once in any of the available variation's types. 

        While this is doable within the tool, it is not compatible with the FLAM3 file format as it requires that a variation be used only once per type ( _types:_ *`PRE`*, *`VAR`*, *`POST`* )
        or you won't be able to save the same result.

        This is true also for applications like Apophysis and Fractorium as they obey the same rule.

        Save the hip file instead.

    _If no name is provided (e.g. empty string) an automated name composed of today's date and current time will be used instead_.
    <br /><br />

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        If "*add iterations to Flame name*" option is *`Off`*/Disabled:
    
        The iterations number you want your fractal Flame to use when you load it back into FLAM3H(tm) can be baked into the preset name you choose for it.

        For instance, the Flame preset "_*My_Awesome_GrandJulia*_" will be loaded with 64 iterations by default.

        However,<br />
        if the iterations number is added to the preset name after a double colon (*`::`*), as in "_*My_Awesome_GrandJulia*_*`::16`*," it will override all settings and load the preset with *`16`* as the iterations numbers.
        
        Therefore,<br />
        do some tests before saving it, and choose the ideal iterations number to incorporate into the preset name.

    as FLAM3H(tm) will save the HSV values into the XML file and set those once you load it back.

    If enabled, all color adjustments you may have made to the Flame's palette will be preserved saving the HSV ramp instead.

    It is helpful if you want to maintain the color-corrected palette when you load the saved Flame into a different program, such as Fractorium or Apophysis.

    This option will clamp the palette colors on save to *`0`*-*`255`* and you should use this only when you want to export the desired colors to be loaded inside Fratorium or Apophysis or other fractal Flame editors out there.
    
    <br />

F3H affine style (OUT) [Icon:TOP/xmlinput] [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:

    F3H affine style format are useful when you rotate iterators using the Rot angle parameter and you still want to reload the Flame using the Rotation value instead of the affine transformed by that Rotation whitch can lead to values that are hard to edit once loaded back into FLAM3H(tm).
    
    When saving an iterator out into a Flame file whitch uses the Rotation angle paramter, FLAM3H(tm) will transform the affine values by it before saving them out so that it is possible to load the saved Flame inside other applications.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *F3H affine style*<br />
    _Below is an example iterator at its default values rotated by 45 degrees inside FLAM3H_:

    *X*: *`1`*, *`0`* <br />
    *Y*: *`0`*, *`1`* <br />
    *O*: *`0`*, *`0`* <br />
    *Rot*: *`45`* 

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *standard affine style*<br />
    _And below is the same iterator affine values transformed by the rotation parameter when saved out into a Flame file. This version is used by other applications on load_:

    *X*: *`0.707107`*, *`-0.707107`* <br />
    *Y*: *`0.707107`*, *`0.707107`* <br />
    *O*: *`0`*, *`0`* 

    <br />
    When this option is *`On`*/Active (_it is by default_), both versions of the affine will be saved into the Flame file so that we can choose to use either one or the other on load using the IN tab option: "F3H affine style".
    <br /><br />

    NOTE:
        There are no reasons to turn this toggle *`Off`* as it cause no harm, however if you would like to have the Flame preset saved without the F3H affine style XML keys at all, turn this *`Off`*.

    *`Off`* by default.

    Cause the OUT Flame name parameter<br />

    <br />
    It will work for Flame presets loaded from a disk file or from the Clipboard.

    <br />

    Activate FLAM3H(tm) Camera sensor visualization.
    
    All the render settings required by third-party programs such as Apophysis and Fractorium are stored together with the fractal Flames when they are saved from FLAM3H(tm).

    A portion of the render parameters deal with the camera and how the fractal Flame you just saved is [framed|Wp:Composition_(visual_arts)].

    *In FLAM3H(tm) the camera sensor will precisely display the image framing*.
    <br /><br />

    The Camera Sensor in fractal Flames defines the virtual plane where the fractal is projected after all transformations have been applied. It acts as the final stage of the rendering pipeline, determining what portion of the fractal world is visible and how it is mapped to the output image.
    
    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Purpose*:
    - Captures the result of the accumulated iterated function system (_IFS_) transformations.
    - Controls the field of view (_FOV_), zoom, and translation of the fractal within the frame.
    - Provides the coordinate mapping from the continuous fractal space to the discrete pixel grid of the output image.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *How It Works in Context*:
    - After iterating and applying variations to generate points, these points exist in an infinite continuous space.
    - The Camera Sensor samples this space through its viewport parameters (_zoom, position, rotation_).
    - Points falling within this viewport are projected onto the sensor plane and rasterized into pixel coordinates.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Notes*:
    - Unlike a physical camera sensor, this element is abstract and primarily mathematical.
    - Changing the sensor settings does not affect fractal generation logic; it only modifies how you see it.
    - Essential for framing compositions, zoom animations, and creating depth in fractal Flames.
    <br /><br />

    _This is meant to be used only when you intend to load the saved fractal Flame into third-party programs and you desire to setup the fractal Flame image framing in Houdini first. Below a screenshot as an example:_

    _*[FLAM3H(tm) to Apophysis, camera sensor framing|https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/42110232/281850238-27f1d534-f6a7-4519-990d-373f3290cc5b.jpg]*_

    When multiple FLAM3H(tm) node are present in the scene, FLAM3H(tm) ensures that, upon entering the Camera Sensor viz mode, there will only ever be one active Camera Sensor viz mode at any given time. This keeps the current viewport from jumping when concurrently stashed viewports are restored and saved at the same time.
    <br /><br />
    
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tips*<br />
    - When in OUT Camera sensor mode, the SYS tab Tag icon will turn red to allow to exit the mode also when inside a different tab other than the OUT tab.
    - When entering the Camera Sensor Viz mode, FLAM3H(tm) will store all the available viewports data prior to entering the mode and restore them all on exit.
    - When entering the Camera Sensor Viz mode while in viewport xforms handles VIZ mode, the xforms handles will be hidden and the camera sensor frame outline will be of color Yellow if not in solo mode and of color Red if in solo mode, like in the below illustration.
    
        _Illustration from left to right_:<br />
        # Entering the camera sensor VIZ mode while the xforms handles VIZ is *`Off`*/Disabled. The sensor outline is of color White.
        # Entering the camera sensor VIZ mode while the xforms handles VIZ is *`On`*/Active. The sensor outline is of color Yellow.
        # Entering the camera sensor VIZ mode while the xforms handles VIZ is *`On`*/Active and in SOLO mode (iterator or FF). The sensor outline is of color Red.

    This XML key is an inexpensive method of achieving *`zoom`* since you will have to manually change the *`quality`* from within the host software because it won't be improved once loaded into third-party apps like Fractorium or Apophysis.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *From Fractorium help page*

    When fractal Flames are zoomed in, they will degrade in appearance and become more speckled/noisy.

    *`Scale`* zooms the image without a corresponding increase in *`quality`*. For images with a small *`scale`* value, or a *`quality`* value that is already large, this shouldn’t increase the noise by much. However, for the inverse situation, you might need to increase the quality a bit to compensate for the increased scale.

    *`Zoom`* does what *`scale`* does, however it greatly increases the *`quality`* to compensate.

    In most cases, using *`zoom`* is overkill and will result in very lengthy renders. You might have a low value for *`quality`*, but after *`zoom`* increases it behind the scenes, the final *`quality`* used will be quite large.
    
    <br />
    _It is for this reason that only [Icon:TOP/xmlinput] *`scale`* is provided in FLAM3H(tm)._

[Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tip*

_When you save a Flame preset to the Clipboard, it will be rootless (not under a [Icon:TOP/xmlinput] *`flames`* XML root key). This is a convention adopted by all the other third-party applications. However FLAM3H(tm) can load a single Flame preset with and without a root. If more than *`1`*(one) Flame preset exist in a file, they must be grouped under the same root._ 

<br />
<br />



:box:
    #display: rounded white

== Preferences == (PREFS)
    
~~~
:box:
    #display: inverted teal

    *prefs:* _FLAM3H(tm) preferences._

    The Preferences tab allows users to customize global settings for FLAM3H(tm), enabling a more tailored and efficient creative workflow. These preferences affect how the software behaves and appears but do not directly impact the visual characteristics of individual fractal Flames.
    
:box:
    #display: rounded white

    == Prefs: General == (PREFSGENERAL)


palette 256+ (PREFS) [Icon:TOP/xmlinput] [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: PALETOUTTE
    *`On`* by default.

    *`[256+]`*<br />
    when this preferences option toggle is *`On`*/Active (_it is by default_), this text in the SYS tab will signal it and when *`Off`*/Disabled it will disappear.
    
    It will allow the OUT Flame to be saved with more than *`256`* color keys assuming you created a palette with this many colors, otherwise it will always save the Flame preset using *`256`* color keys.
    
    If the palette color keys are less than *`256`*, it will always sample the palette at *`256`* when saving out the Flame preset.<br />
    The maximun Palette color keys you can use are *`1024`*, if you create a Palette with more, it will be clamped and sampled at *`1024`*.

    _It will use a banding system to determine how many colors/samples to use_:
    
    - Anything below *`256`* color keys, it will always sample and save the Flame using a palette with *`256`* colors.
    - Anything above *`256`* color keys and below/equal *`512`*, it will use *`512`* colors/samples on save.
    - Anything above *`512`* color keys and below/equal *`1024`*, it will use *`1024`* colors/samples on save.
    - Anything above *`1024`* color keys they will be clamped and sampled at *`1024`* colors.
    <br /><br />

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        - Fractorium will work properly when loading a Flame with more than *`256`* colors.
        - When you are adding more than *`256`* colors keys to the palette either by editing it or by loading a Flame or Palette preset with that many colors, a message in the CP tab UI will show up as: *`[256+]`*.

    :warning:
        Apophysis v7.x will error out if you try to load a Flame with more than *`256`* colors.<br /><br />
        If you created a palette with more than *`256`* color keys<br />
        and want to save the Flame preset to be loaded inside Apophysis,<br />
        turn this toggle *`Off`* before saving the Flame preset out<br />
        so it will sample the palette with *`256`* samples and save the Flame preset with *`256`* color keys.

    <br />

SOLO Follow [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: PALETOUTTE
    *`On`* by default.

    When any iterator has its xform handle in SOLO mode already ([Icon:opdef:.?icon_xfHandlesEnabledMPIDXSVG.svg]),<br />
    it causes the iterator that is picked from the SYS tab's select iterator mini-menu to be automatically configured to be in SOLO mode.
    
    This enables you to swiftly go over each one automatically.

    To prevent the selected iterator from being in SOLO mode while being selected,<br />
    turn this *`Off`*.

    <br />

flash messages (network editor) [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: prefs
    *`On`* by default.<br />

    Causes a message to appear briefly in the upper left corner of the network editor, then fade away.
    
    Copy/Paste iterators and FF data uses flash messages, as well as some other features.

:box:
    #display: round white
    
    == Prefs: UI == (PREFSUI)

Enumerate presets menus [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: prefs
    *`On`* by default.

    Causes the presets menus inside the CP, IN and OUT tab to be enumerated.<br />
    This make it easy to remember a particular preset you liked while trying out others inside the loaded library file.
    
    Turn this *`Off`* to only display the raw preset names.

    <br />

Iterator menus bookmark icons [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: prefs
    *`Off`* by default.
    
    When you turn this toggle *`On`* causes the variation menus inside each iterator to have a bookmark icon (_FLAME and FF tabs_)
    
    This mode will change each variation's menu based of the value of their weight hence it will take a hit on the UI performance.
    
    When you turn this toggle back *`Off`*, Houdini will save the current FLAM3H(tm) definition and match it in order to force the menus to update inside the multiparameter FLAME tab. It will aslo revert the density value to its default *`500k`*(_thousands_) points as a way to reduce the waiting time.

    #display: round white
    
    == Prefs: Cvex (hidden)== (PREFSCVEX)

cvex precision modes (hidden) [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu]:
    #id: prefs
    Switch between the default Single Precision ( [32-bit|Wp:32-bit_computing] ) or Double Precision ( [64-bit|Wp:64-bit_computing] ).
    <br /><br />

    :warning:
        Double precision *`64-bits`* will be really slow. I'm saying it again: "really slow".

        Unless you notice some significant artifacts and you genuinely adore the fractal Flame you are working on, always use *`32-bit`* which is the default.


:box:
    #display: rounded white

    == Prefs: Xaos == (PREFSXAOS)
        
menu xaos modes [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu]:
    #id: prefs
    Select to use xaos in either *xaos TO* or *xaos FROM* mode.
    
    - Switching between xaos modes will convert the xaos: string values inside each iterator so that you can see how the new weights adjusted to fit the new mode.

    _Some of the menu labels posses a bookmark icon_:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarWhiteSVG.svg] mark the default preset.
    <br /><br />

    NOTE:
        Xaos FROM mode will internally be converted into xaos TO on save and reloaded as xaos TO when saving out Flame files.

:box:
    #display: rounded white

    == Prefs: Density == (PREFSDENSITY)

Density :
    #id: prefs
    Set a custom density value for the fractal Flame.<br />
    
    If the global -> density menu entries do not have what you need<br />
    you can set a custom density value using this parameter.

    If the choosen value is not present in the global -> density menu entries,<br />
    the global -> density menu label will become empty to signal the use of a custom density value here.

    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tip*<br />
    - This is the only place where you are allowed to animate the density value.

    #display: rounded white

    == Prefs: Camera == (PREFSCAM)
            
Camera handle [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: prefs
    *`Off`* by default.
    
    Display the viewport camera handle to help frame/center your fractal Flame.<br /><br />
    On the left, you will have the FLAM3H(tm) node name, and on the right, the selected camera name.
    <br /><br />

    NOTE:
        The handles are properly scaled and visible only when looking through a perspective type of camera, not when looking through an orthogonal type of camera.
    
    
    :warning:
        Turn this *`Off`* when rendering.

    <br />
    
Camera cull [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: prefs
    *`Off`* by default.

    Enable [culling|Wp:Viewing_frustum] based on camera view.
    
cam:
    #id: prefs
    Pick a camera to use for either the handle or the culling.

    == Prefs: Viewport == (PREFSVIEW)
    
Dark [Icon:DATATYPES/boolean]:
    #id: prefs
    *`Off`* by default.

    If it isn't already, change the viewport's color scheme to dark.
    
    If unchecked,<br />
    it will remember the color scheme for every viewport and fall back on it.<br />
    Checking this box has no effect if the color scheme in a viewport is already dark.

    <br /><br />
    [Icon:NETWORKS/sop] *Context aware*<br />
    - This option is context aware, and it will function only if a Sop viewer is available.
    
menu type [Icon:BUTTONS/pane_menu]:
    #id: prefs
    Set the viewport particle display mode to either *`points`* or *`pixels`*.

    _Some of the menu labels posses a bookmark icon_:

    - [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarWhiteSVG.svg] mark the default preset.
    <br /><br />

    NOTE:
        At the moment of this writing (up to H21):<br />
        It is suggested to go to the Houdini: *`Edit`*->*`Preferences`*->*`3Dviewport`* and set the Renderer to *`OpenGL`* as it provide a better points visualization in the viewport when millions of them are displayed and/or their viewport point size is smaller than *`1`*(one).<br />
        
        Changing the viewer renderer will require a restart of Houdini.

    <br /><br />
    [Icon:NETWORKS/sop] *Context aware*<br />
    - This option is context aware, and it will function only if a Sop viewer is available.<br />

Size:
    #id: prefs
    When viewport particle display is set to *`points`*, this parameter will control their size in the viewport.

    <br /><br />
    [Icon:NETWORKS/sop] *Context aware*<br />
    - This option is context aware, and it will function only if a Sop viewer is available.<br />

Size default:

    - ((LMB)) to reset the point size to a default of *`1`*(one).

Wire width:
    #id: prefs
    When the SYS -> "xforms handles VIZ" is *`On`*/Active, this parameter will set the wire curves thickness for the viewport display. A value of *`3`*(three) is generally good.

    *FLAM3H(tm) Rendering tips*. _A few small tips to render your fractal Flame images._


== Rendering: Workflow tips == (RENDWFTIPS)
    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] Workflow tips:
        #id: rendering
    
    You can keep the FLAM3H(tm) node live without the need to bake the processed point cloud while rendering
    and just change density values to go from low/quick renders to high/slow render times. Adjust the point size *`@pscale`* ( _in Solaris:_ *`@widths`* ) accordingly.

    When using Karma renderer:

    - With *`64gb`* of physical memory you will be able to render *`500M points`* without weight much on virtual memory.
    
    - With *`128gb`* of physical memory you will be able to render *`1 billion points`* without weight much on virtual memory.

    You can take advantage of packed disk primitives to increase the number of points you can render.<br />
    Please read the Mantra tips below for more infos on the concept and the why.
    <br /><br />

    TIP:
        #display: orange
        When using Mantra, you can take advantage of _delayed loads_ to greatly increase the amount of points you can render, in which case you must bake those points out in a *`*.bgeo.sc`* files first.
        
        A non-deterministic random number generator was used to construct FLAM3H(tm), and it lies at the heart of the algorithm.
        As a result, the points produced by FLAM3H(tm) nodes will always be in a little bit of a different location every time it cook.
        This is perfect for cloning FLAM3H(tm) nodes and layering them into a single fractal Flame to improve the quality of the final result.

:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] Point size:
        #id: rendering
    
    For simplicity, FLAM3H(tm) sets all *`@pscale`* to a value of *`0.001`*.<br />
    Any necessary adjustments can be made using a wrangle or the upstream geometry node point size multiplier. 
    It's important to keep in mind that *`@pscale`* will become *`@widths`* when importing FLAM3H(tm) into Stage/Solaris.
    
    As a general rule, the more points, the smaller the *`@pscale`* or *`@widths`* values need to be.

    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] Karma/Mantra tips:
        #id: Karma/Mantra tips
    
    - When rendering with Karma, remember to turn *`On`* the "_Simplified lighting_"/"_Disable lighting_" option' toggle to be sure to render the points with their full color values.
    
    - When rendering with Mantra, just create a constant shader that uses the *`@Cd`* attribute.

    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] Tip:
        #id: Point value accumulation tips

    It will be crucial to experiment with the CP HSV values, notably the "*S*" (_Saturation_) and, most crucially, the "*V*" (_Value_).
    The more dense portions of the Flame will get brighter if the Value in HSV is increased from the default value of *`1`*(one), bringing the appearance of the Flame closer to that of a typical fractal Flame.

    <br />
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Points color values accumulation tips*:<br />
    
    - _The following is valid for the time being and it will be subject to change sometime in the future._<br />
    - _Each pixel color sample that follow is indicative for reference._

    Since this implementation was crafted within Houdini,<br />
    it chose to employ an alternative strategy to accumulate point color values while utilizing some of Houdini's technology rather than adhering to the same procedure as the original `Flam3` *`C`* source code.<br />
    (_building a_ [buffer|Wp:Data_buffer] _with the_ [histogram|Wp:Histogram], _or summation/accumulation, of every point in every pixel_).

    We will do something similar—not exactly the same, but close.<br />

    Rather than doing it ourselves,<br />
    we will allow Houdini and the selected renderer do it for us in some way, and it will happen at [render|Wp:Rendering_(computer_graphics)] time.<br />

    To illustrate the idea and approach taken, consider the following illustration:

    [Image:opdef:.?FLAM3H_DOC_pixels_grid.svg]

    The above illustration shows a grid of pixels,<br />
    with the one we'll utilize in this example being the one that is marked in red.<br />

    A [pixel|Wp:Pixel] is really the lowest size that may exist in a picture in 2D applications; nothing can fit inside of one.

    In Houdini (_or any other 3D application_), a pixel is the smallest unit of measurement in the final output image.<br />
    However, during rendering, it can be thought of as a tiny window to the 3D virtual world we are processing;<br />
    as a result, a pixel can be interpreted as a small domain with an area, through which we can see a tiny portion of that 3D virtual world.

    The fractal Flame points have an attribute call: *`@pscale`* which define the real dimension of each point inside this world:

    [Image:opdef:.?FLAM3H_DOC_point_dimension.svg]

    Now lets set the "*V*" (_Value_) in the HSV paramater to *`4`*(_four_) and lets zoom into the highlighted pixel.<br />

    We can now see some points of the fractal Flame we are rendering, as illustrated in the following picture:

    [Image:opdef:.?FLAM3H_DOC_pixel_view.svg]

    Those points, in relation to the area of the pixel/window, have a certain percentage of coverage.<br />
    In this example, the final color of that pixel will be somewhere in the ball park of *`~80%`* red and *`~20%`* green 
    and its final value, assuming the empty space have a value of *`0`*(_Zero_) will be in the ball park of *`~0.8`* or similar.

    However,<br />
    if more and more points happen to be visible through that pixel/window like in the following picture:

    [Image:opdef:.?FLAM3H_DOC_pixel_fill.svg]

    the final color of that pixel will now be in the ball park of *`~5%`* red and *`~95%`* green and its value in the ball park of *`~3.8`*, hence simulating a point values accumulation algorithm at no extra cost on our end.<br />
    Setting the "*V*" (_Value_) in the HSV paramater at the beginning to *`4`*(_four_) it was like instructing the renderer about the final max value the image will have at any given pixel if it come to that.

    That's why it is important to play with the "*V*" (_Value_) in the HSV paramater and the points *`@pscale`* value.

    Using the output image *`Alpha`* channel as mask to brightnen further the more dense areas of the fractal will be the cherry on top of the cake.

    *FLAM3H(tm) Cvex*. _How to Compile and update_.
    
    In this section,<br /> 
    you will find information on how to compile and then update FLAM3H(tm) Cvex code in case you'd like to modify/extend its core functionalities.

    For example,<br />
    you may want to add more variations to its current arsenal of already implemented variations ( _currently there are *106* implemented_ ).
    
    Extending the Cvex code base,<br /> 
    most likely require you to update/extend the Python code base as well, since both go hand in hand with many of the core algorithm functionalities.

    In order to improve speed, the Cvex code base has been scaled down to its bare minimum;<br />
    this results in the least amount of code required to implement the entire algorithm.<br /> 
    Be as conservative as you can if you want to add anything.


== Cvex: How to compile == (COMPILE)
    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] Compile Cvex:
        #id: Cvex
    
    _SideFX made this part very easy_:
    
    # Open a Houdini 19 or higher, Command line Tools shell
    # Navigate into the directory where the cvex source files are located
    # To compile any of the available cvex source files, run this command:
    
        {{{
        #!vex
        vcc -c cvex sourceFile.vfl -o outputFile.vex
        }}}
    
    - *vcc* is the name of the Houdini's cvex/vex compiler
    - *-c* to specify a Houdini context, in this case the context is: *cvex*
    - *-o* to specify an output filename ( *.vex* _extension_ )
    
    The FLAM3H(tm) source files are already named as expected.
    
    - The output file name must be the same as the input source file name<br />
    ( _only the file extension will be different, of course_ ).
    
        - Source -> _"cvex_TheFractalFlameAlgorithm.*vfl*"_
    
        - Output -> _"cvex_TheFractalFlameAlgorithm.*vex*"_
    
== Cvex: How to update FLAM3H(tm) node == (UPDATE)
    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] Reload Cvex:
        #id: Cvex
    
    Inside the FLAM3H(tm) node, you will find many wrangle core nodes running a compiled Cvex file.
    
    If you end up updating the Cvex code yourself by extending it: 
    
    # Update the sourceFile.*vfl* with all the changes/additions you desire, and follow the above steps on *Cvex: How to compile*.
    # Once you are ready, remove the old compiled Cvex file from: *FLAM3H(tm) *-> *Type properties* -> *extra files*.
    # Locate the new compiled Cvex file and load it back inside *FLAM3H(tm) * -> *Type properties* -> *extra files*.
    # Before you click: *Add file*, remove the extension from the filename inside the "*Section name*"
        - e.g. From: _*cvex_TheFractalFlameAlgorithm.vex*_ To: _*cvex_TheFractalFlameAlgorithm*_
    # Click *Apply* or *Accept* to confirm your changes.
    # Go inside the FLAM3H(tm) node and on any of the *`wrangle core`* nodes, click the:
        
        * *`Reload Cvex icon`*: [Largeicon:opdef:.?icon_cvex_compileSVG.svg]
    
    You just need to click it once,<br />
    and it will reload all the compiled Cvex code files included, the wrangle core node you click the icon from is not important.
    
    Once clicked and as soon as FLAM3H(tm) cook again,<br />
    it will Re-Compile all FLAM3H(tm) Cvex nodes. Depending on your PC configuration it can take up to *`1`*(one) minute. It is a one time compile process.

@Limitations

:box:
    #display: inverted pink

    *FLAM3H(tm) Limitations*.
    
    The following are limitations to keep in mind when authoring your Flames in Fractorium or Apophysis to be loaded inside FLAM3H(tm).
    Some of these limitations are in place to maintain performance within the Cvex language restrictions.<br />
    Some other are caused by Houdini bugs, in those cases a reference to the bug submission is provided.

== Limitations: Iterators count ==
    
:box:
    #display: rounded gray
    
    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] Iterator's count:
        #id: Limitations
    
    FLAM3H(tm) allows you to create as many iterators as you wish.<br />

    However,<br />
    when using xaos you are only permitted to create a maximum of *`20`* iterators.<br />
    This is a workaround to make xaos work due to a Houdini bug.

    <br />
    _For reference_:

    *`10/10/2022`* -> _*Submitted*_<br />
    - Houdini version: _19.0.720_<br />
    - Description: _Issue with the_ `sample_cdf()` _function when the CDF is varying over the VEX processor array_.<br />
    - Bug ID# *`124486`*<br />
    - SideFX Support Ticket: *`SESI# 128304`*

    <br />
    *`08/28/2025`* -> _*Fixed*_<br />

    with one ( _the first one to always be executed_ ) being: *`pre_blur`*, followed by the other two.
    
    It is really *`pre_blur`* plus *`2`*(two) *`PRE`* variations of your choice.
    <br /><br />

    NOTE:
        The weight of the *`PRE`* variations can not be negative in FLAM3H(tm).

        #id: Limitations
    
    Each iterator has only one set of parametric variation parameters shared within the *`PRE`*, *`VAR`* and *`POST`* variations.

    _This means if you use_:
    - *`2`*(two) *`PRE Mobius`*
    - *`4`*(four) *`VAR Mobius`*
    - *`1`*(one) *`POST Mobius`*

    they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters (_FLAME: VARS tab_).

    This finalXform(_FF_) does not possess any color parameters in this implementation ( _Chaotica style_ ).
    <br /><br />

    NOTE:
        _When saving a Flame out from Fractorium/Apophysis with a finalXform(FF) remember to set the finalXform color to:_
        - Color -> *`0`*(Zero)
        - Color Speed -> *`0`*(Zero) ( _this is the most important_ )
        - Direct Color -> *`1`*(one)
        
        _This way, you won't add a color to the Flame that FLAM3H(tm) won't be able to match._
