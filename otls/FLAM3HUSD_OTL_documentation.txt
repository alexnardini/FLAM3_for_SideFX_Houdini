"""Simple utility node to quickly render FLAM3H fractal flames in Solaris."""

== Welcome to FLAM3HUSD for SideFX Houdini ==

A simple utility node to make rendering FLAM3H fractal flames in Solaris for previews easy.<br />
It offers the very fundamental functionalities to setup your fractal flames point cloud and start rendering with Karma within a few clicks.<br />

Currently, FLAM3HUSD rely entirely on Karma CPU.

_*This tool is under development and it may or may not change drastically in the future.*_<br />

FLAM3H SOP path [Icon:DATATYPES/string]:
    #id: IMPORT
    Path to the FLAM3H node to be imported inside Solaris.
    A default path is already provided to import the default first FLAM3H node name. Change this as needed.

    [Icon:opdef:.?icon_optionStarBlueSVG.svg] *Tips*<br />
    - Once a valid FLAM3H node has been imported, FLAM3HUSD will take care of bulding a useful Scene Graph Tree.
    - When multiple FLAM3HUSD are created, the imported FLAM3H data will all be grouped under a common root named: FLAM3H.
