"""Simple utility node to quickly setup fractal flames point clouds in Solaris."""

== Welcome to FLAM3HUSD for SideFX Houdini ==

A simple utility node that will make it easier to render FLAM3H fractal flames in Solaris for previews.
It offers the very fundamental functionalities to setup your fractal flame point cloud to start rendering with Karma within a few clicks.

_*This version is only compatible with FLAM3H v1.6.84 or higher.*_

== FLAM3HUSD import == (IMPORT)
    
~~~
:box:
    #display: inverted teal

    *FLAM3HUSD import*

FLAM3H SOP path:
    #id: IMPORT
    Path to the FLAM3H node to be imported inside Solaris.
    A default path is already provided to import the default first FLAM3H node name. Change this as needed.
    
    
== Prefs == (PREFS)

:box:
    #display: rounded white
    
    == Viewport == (OPTIONS)
    
dark:
    #id: PREFS
    If it isn't already, change the viewport's color scheme to dark.
    If unchecked, it will remember the color scheme for every viewport and fall back on it.
    Checking this box has no effect if the color scheme in a viewport is already dark.
    
renderer:
    #id: PREFS
    Select from a variety of Hydra renderers.
    
:box:
    #display: rounded white
    
    == Renderer: GL == (OPTIONSGL)
    
display:
    #id: prefs
    Either points or pixels should be selected for the viewport particle display mode.
    
size:
    #id: prefs
    The setting for viewport particle display Points. Define how big the particles appear in the viewport.
    
:box:
    #display: rounded white
    
    == Renderer: Karma CPU == (OPTIONSKARMA)
    
NOTE:
    Karma should only be used for previews while you are interactively perfecting your fractal flame.
    All the settings are already fine tuned for fractal flames previews ( _simplified lighting_ is ON ).
    
    As soon as you're satisfied, set up your own Karma renderer nodes to output the finished pictures.
    
points widths:
    #id: IMPORT
    The point attribute *`@pscale`* will become *`@widths`* when importing FLAM3H into Stage/Solaris.
    This option, which is a multiplier, enables rapid adjustments while Karma is rendering interactively.

pixel samples:
    #id: prefs
    This will set the render samples when the Karma renderer is chosen.
    
denoiser:
    #id: prefs
    Give you the option to choose from the available denoisers when the Karma renderer is selected.

FLAM3H Shader:
    #id: prefs
    Use a MaterialX Shader that will allow to change Gamma and HSV values on the fly.
