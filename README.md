## The Fractal Flame Algorithm for SideFX Houdini

An implementation of FLAM3 inside SideFX Houdini software using CVEX programming language.

The code went up and down during the past months and finally settled
for the most minimalistic version in favor of performace.

Some nice addition to this would be:

- Xaos

- Ability to load and save ".flame" file format. (stripping out whats allowed)

- Ability to Dublicate iterators ( probably easy to add with a python call back script)

- All python addition to improve and make the workflow more enjoable.
  Ability to copy paste parameters from one iterator to the other and simlar things nice to have.

- More variations even tho using CVEX performace wil need to be safe guarded.
