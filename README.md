# FLAM3
## The Fractal Flame Algorithm for SideFX Houdini

## Based on the original "The Fractal Flame Algorithm: FLAM3".

One variation per iterator is the default limit. However, there are currently 100+ variations to choose from ( each one with their own 3D version ), and as optional: pre blur variations ( pb ), post variations ( pv ), final flame transform ( FF ) and variationâ€™s iterators ( VI ); not to mention motion blur, too.
