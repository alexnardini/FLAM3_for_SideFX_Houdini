@intro

FLAM3H, as the name suggest, is the implementation of the "fractal Flame algorithm" inside SideFX Houdini 19.x.
There have been many revisions of the same algorithm in the past years, this is the implementation of: *FLAM3*.

Fractal Art is not easy, at all. For this reason it is suggested that you posses prior experience with this Art form, may that be with Apophysis, Fractorium or really any other fractal Flame editor out there.
This implementation took inspiration, especially in the fast/quick workflow, from Apophysis, but also it has been biased in its underlying code toward Fractorium.

There is a very big, kind and talented fractal Art community out there where you can tap into and gather lots of informations for you to learn.

As a general rule, and following my own learning process, every tutorial you can find for any of the available fractal Flame editor out there can be accomplished using FLAM3H.
The vast majority of available tutorials you'll find are for Apophysis, mostly because it was the very first, if ever, implementation with a graphical GUI of the algorithm.
It became, probably, the most popular fractal Flame editor ever created and will always hold a special place in the history of fractal art.

A lot of time has been spent in making sure that, assuming you are using the same variations available inside FLAM3H and stay within its limits, you will get a one to one match result.

:box:
    #display: inverted teal

    *GLOBAL*
    
    Here you will define the quality of the fractal Flame algorithm solution.

density:
    #id: GLOBAL
    Number of points to use. For high quality fractals start from 20M up to 500M and more depending of the type of Fractal Flame you are ending up with. As a general rule, the more the better.
    * Must find the sweet spot between quality and processing time.

    
density presets mini menu:
    #id: GLOBAL
    Will allow you to select a density value quickly out of some presets.
    
Reset density:
    #id: Global
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconBlackSVG.svg]
    
    Reset density to its default: 500k
        
    
iterations:
    #id: GLOBAL
    Number of iterations to use.
    - You do not need many iterations to get some good fractal Flames going, between 10 and 24 is usually more than you need while keeping execution speed acceptable.
    - If you increase an iterator weight, use xaos to build containers or use some kind of variations you will require higher number to resolve and show you the proper result.
    
    Almost all of the fractal Flames showcased inside FLAM3 for Houdini instagram account
    use a maximun of 64 iterations with a few exceptions reaching 96 and in rare cases 128/256 and more.
    
    Some Flames require truly an high amount of iterations to resolve properly.

    Below are some presets that Chaotica software ship with, ported inside FLAM3 for Houdini.
    They have been choosen because they use variations I have implemented too and because some are really expensive to solve.

    Some require thousands of iterations to show you the proper results, 
    some of them require hundreds and some others are really quick.

    TIP:
        You can create some beautiful fractal Flames with just 6 iterations, below an example I did myself:

    TIP:
        When: *Auto add iter num to Flame name* toggle is ON inside the OUT Tab,
        changing the iterations parameter will updated the Flame name if any have been typed.

    *SYS:* _System utilities._
    
    Utilities at hand to help improve and speed up the workflow.
    
    TIP:
        Once properly setup, from this Tab you will be able to do almost everything without never leave the main FLAME or FF Tabs
        while building your fractal Flame logic and look.

    
FF:
    #id: SYS
    Enable finalXform transform/iterator.
    
RIP:
    #id: SYS
    Remove Invalid Points. *INF*, *NAN*, *Zero Opacity* and *out of bounds* points.
    * It can happen that some points shoot to infinity after being transformed by the algorithm.
    Set this ON when rendering ( especially for a sequence ) to fix black/failed frames if you encounter any.
    
    NOTE:
        If you notice some unusual slowness while rendering a flame,
        it's probably because some points endup being far far away from the ZERO world.
        Turning this option ON will get rid of those points.
        
TAG:
    #id: SYS
    
    Enable vieport TAG infos.
    
    _This shoud always be On as it is useful to review the fractal Flame being worked on. The iterator weight is displayed also per each iterator._
    
    * Iterations number will be the very first number inside square brackets.
    * Xaos will be next inside square brackets only when Xaos is active. ( read the Xaos documentation to know when. )
    * Xaos TO will be: *Xt*
    * Xaos FROM wil be: *Xf*
    * Iterator variations are lowercase.
    * FF variations are UPPER CASE.
    * "*pre_blur*" will be indicated witn an asterisk * at the beginning of each iterator and before all variations.
    * PRE variations will be inside square brackets at the beginning of each iterator or FF.
    * POST variations will be inside square brackets at the end of each iterator or FF
    * The iterator's Weight value will be last in each iterator.
    
    * The colons *:* indicate how many variations slots are still available ( 4 in case of an iterator VAR section ).
    
    TIP:
        The Tag icon will change when:
        
        - [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconBlueStarRedSVG.svg]: when "*auto set xaos*" is *ON* 
        - [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconRedSVG.svg]: when "*auto set xaos*" is *OFF*

    Load one of the presets inside the IN Tab Flame file currently loaded.
    This is being added as it is handy to change preset without the need to go inside the IN Tab all the time.
    
    TIP:
        To populate this menu, load a valid *.flame file first inside the *IN* Tab.
    
IN Preset reload:
    #id: SYS
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconWhiteSVG.svg]
    
    Click to reload the selected IN preset if any.
    This has been added to quickly updated a preset you are loading inside the IN Tab while editing it inside Fractorium for example, 
    always saving the Flame over the same flame file you are loading in. 
    Just quickly click this icon to update it in Houdini without the hustle to go inside the IN Tab, click the F reload icon and back to where you were.

OUT Presets mini menu:
    #id: SYS
    This menu is only for information purpose.
    It will show the Flames contained in the selected output file if any are presents.
    Once you append a new Flame in it, this menu will update too.
    It will always be set to the last Flameâ€™s name you saved.
    
    TIP:
        To populate this menu, load a valid *.flame file first inside the *OUT* Tab.
        
    NOTE:
        Saving Flames from this icon, will always use a default name that use current date and time.
        In case you'd like to give your flames a proper name, you can do so from inside the OUT Tab.

    #id: SYS
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconWhiteStarSVG.svg]
    
    Click to Save this flame inside the selected OUT file if any.
    
    ((LMB)) to save the current flame into the selected OUT file.
    
    - If the selected file do not exist, it will be created.
    - If the selected file exist and already contain some Flames in it, it will append the current one.
    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) to erase the content of the file and overwrite it with only the current Flame.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) will open the file explorer to the file location.
    
    _If the selected file is not a valid Flame file type, nothing will happen._

    #display: inverted teal

    *FLAME:* _Flame xforms/iterators._
    
    This is, together with the *FF* Tab, the place where you will spend most of your time.
    
    Inside here you will build your fractal Flame logic.
    If you have ever used Apophysis, Fractorium or other fractal Flame editors, you will find almost at home
    as every parameter carry on the same name inside here. The logic you will operate with will be the same.
    

iterators:
    #id: FLAME
    Number of iterators to use.
    * This is equivalent to the number of triangle handles you have inside popular fractal Flame editors out there.
    * Every iterator act as a container of functions, the algorithm will them mix/shuffle them based on your logic.
    
    NOTE:
        The order of the iterators do not matter at all,
        for this reason it is suggested to create them one after the other sequentially.
    
:box:
    #display: rounded white

    *iterator*

note:
    #id: FLAME
    A name for this iterator.
    
    NOTE:
        The text you'll enter here, will be saved with the flame file and will show up
        as the iterator's name inside Apophysis and Fractorium as well.
    
copy/paste:
    #id: FLAME
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconBlackStarSVG.svg]
    
    ((LMB)) to mark this iterator for being copied. 
    
    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) to PASTE the copied values into another iterator. It will copy everything, parametric variation's parameters included but not XAOS. To copy XAOS, use the copy/paste mini menu
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) will unmark this iterator for being copied.
    
    It will work also between different FLAM3H nodes.
    
    Once you copy an iterator you can have access to the arrow icon menu next to the *F* icon.
    From this menu you will be able to paste specific sections from the copied iterator, xaos incuded.
    
A tip:
    #id: FLAME
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconBluStarSVG.svg]
    
    Show active iterator informations and tips.
    
A:
    #id: FLAME
    Enable/Disable this iterator.
    
    TIP:
        If an iterator is disabled, it wont be included when saving the Flame out into a flame file.
        In case you still want to include the inactive iterator into the file, set its Weight to Zero instead.
    
W:
    #id: FLAME
    The iterator weight. Define the probability this iterator is choosen during the chaos game.
    The higher an iterator weight is compared to the others and the more iterations you may need to properly resolve the fractal Flame's shapes you are working on..
    
:box:
    #display: rounded white

    *iterator: xaos*
    
xaos:
    #id: FLAME
    
    NOTE:
        *When using XAOS, you are allowed to use up to 20 iterators max.*
        Using more than 20 iterators will disable the algorithm.
        
        This is a workaround to make XAOS work due to a Houdini bug: *Bug ID# 124486*, *SideFX Support Ticket SESI #128304*
    
    [Image:opdef:.?FLAM3H_DOC_xaosSVG.svg]
    _The above image shows 5 iterators with one variation each and how they are connected to each others through an hipotetical xaos setting._
        

    
    The default mode is *xaos TO*. You can change it to use *xaos FROM* mode instead in the preferences tab.
    
    _*xaos TO* and *xaos FROM* are at their core each other reflection. This mean they are the same data but one is the transpose of the other._
    
    _A matrix transpose is a matrix flipped along its diagonal. Think of it as looking at the same matrix from 2 opposite point of views._
    
    *Looking from an iterator point of view*:
    - When in *xaos_TO* mode, you will think like: *to* wich iterator am I allowed to send points I just executed?
    - When in *xaos_FROM* mode, you will think like: *from* wich iterator am I allowed to receive points before I execute them myself?
    - _*Note* that the same concept apply also for the iterator itself, this mean the question will be: can I execute a point after I already executed it myself? ( like the iterator with the Curl variation in the above image. )_
    
    *How to set xaos in FLAM3 for Houdini:*
    
    NOTE:
        The following rules apply only if "*auto set xaos*" preferences option is *OFF*.
        
    - To set XAOS for a flame with 4 iterators, use the "*xaos:*" keyword followed by each iterator weights values separated by a colon: *xaos:1:2:3:4*.
    - When *auto space xaos weights* option is ON ( it is OFF by default ), the xaos keyword will look like so: "*xaos :*". The important information here is that you always need a semicolon "*:*" after the word "*xaos*" to make it work.
    - If no set or when using a short descriptive note, FLAM3 will assume all XAOS values are 1.0, the equivalent of: *xaos:1:1:1:1*
    - If you set only iterator 1 and iterator 2, FLAM3 will always fill in the rest with a value of 1.0. *xaos:0:0* will be interpreted as *xaos:0:0:1:1*
    - When turning iterators OFF and ON, FLAM3H will internally remove and reformat XAOS values to account for missing iterators so you wont need to remove values from the command string, *unless you delete an iterator in witch case you will require to modify the "XAOS:" string*.
    - If you type a non numeric character in any of the xaos's weights or miss to add a semicolon "*:*" after the word *xaos*, the entire xaos string will be re-set with all the weights of value: *1.0*.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
    
        XAOS is OFF by default and FLAM3H will activate it automatically
        only when needed. (ex: when one of its weights is set to a value different than the others, ex: *xaos:3:3:3:2.9* ).
        
    NOTE:
        When saving out flame files, XAOS FROM mode will internally be converted into XAOS TO on save and reloaded as XAOS TO.
        
auto space xaos weights / Xaos information tips:
    #id: FLAME
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconBlueStarRedSVG.svg]
    
    When "*auto set xaos*" preferences option is *ON*:
    
    - ((LMB)) Will space the xaos weights for easy read and count ( ON/OFF )
    
    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) to show Xaos informations and tips.
    
    When "*auto set xaos*" preference option is *OFF*:
    
    - ((LMB)) It will just display the Xaos informations and tips.
 
:box:
    #display: rounded white

    *iterator: shader*

location:
    #id: FLAME
    The color location in the ramp *{0:1}*.
    
speed:
    #id: FLAME
    Speed of color blending between iterations. Values above ZERO attract the selected color while values below ZERO will repel it.
    
opacity:
    #id: FLAME
    The opacity of the current transform/iterator. Opacity 0 means it will be entirely transparent, and opacity 1, entirely opaque.
    It can be used also to fine tune your fractal Flame, making parts of it more or less prominent in addition to the iterator's weight.
    
    TIP:
        When an iterator's opacity is *`0.0`* ( *ZERO* ), you can activate the SYS Tab *RIP* option to get rid of those points ( since *opacity* = *`@pscale`* (*`@widths`* in Solaris ) you dnt need them anymore.)
    
:box:
    #display: rounded white

    *iterator: variations*
     
pre_blur:
    #id: FLAME
    *Enable pre_blur*. Pre_blur variation in this implementaion is hard coded inside the chaos game to be as fast as it can possibly be.
    It will always be the FIRST pre variation the algorithm will run.
    
    TIP:
        When authoring your Flame in Fractorium or Apophysis, if you are planning to load them inside FLAM3 for Houdini
        remeber that the variation "pre_gaussian_blur" will be remapped to "pre_blur" on Flame load by default.
        
        You can change this beahavior and load "pre_gaussian_blur" variation instead if any, inside the IN Tab.
    
pre:
    #id: FLAME
    Enable PRE Variations for the selected iterator.
    
var:
    #id: FLAME
    List of variations to choose from.
    While PRE and POST variations act as an assignment, variations are cumulative.
        
    - Variation's name that end with an asterisk(*) are dependent while if they end with 3 dots(...) are parametric. When a parametric variation is selected, its parameters will populate the *VARS* Tab.
    - Each iterators allow up to 8 variations ( pre-blur var, 2 PRE vars, 4 VARS plus 1 POST var) to be used.
    
    NOTE:
        When using parametric variations, their parameters in the VAR Tab will be shared between all of them. This mean if you use 2 pre Mobius, 4 Mobius and 1 post Mobius, they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
    
        A good way to try out the variations, is to laydown a fresh FLAM3 node
        and while using the default Siepinsky triangle activate the Final Flame transform (*FF*)
        and change variations there to see the result. ( remember to play a bit with the affine coefficents to check the results )    

post:
    #id: FLAME
    Enable POST Variation for the selected iterator.
    For speed purpose only one post variation is allowed at the moment.
        
w:
    #id: FLAME
    The weight of the selected variation. ZERO will be inactive, 1 will be 100%.
    Can be set higher than 1 and negative too.
    * If more than one variation is active, remember that as a general rule it is suggested ( not mandatory ) to have the sum of all weights equal to 1.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        
        It is better to set a variation weight to ZERO instead of keeping it at a very low values if their contribution is not noticable to reduce the cost of the computation. At ZERO the variation will be completely ignored.

post:
    #id: FLAME
    Enable post affine.
    
pre affine:
    #id: FLAME
    Affine transformation's coefficients for the current iterator ( xform ).
    
    NOTE:
        A linear transformation cannot be used to translate a set of points. 
        
        To translate a set of points, we need to use an *_affine transformation_*. 
        An *_affine transformation_* multiplies a vector by a matrix, just as in a linear transformation, 
        and then adds a vector to the result ( the *O*._xy_ `vector2` component ). 
        This added vector carries out the translation. 
        By applying an affine transformation to an image on the screen we can do everything a linear transformation can do, 
        and also have the ability to move the image up or down and left or right.

    Each iterator( xform ) has an affine transform that is always applied on every iteration.
    This is known as the pre affine becasue it is applied before the variations.
    
    
    - With *X*._`xy`_ and *Y*._`xy`_ you will apply rotation and scale/shear while with *O*._`xy`_ you will apply translation/offset.
    - They compose a 2x3 matrix ( *X*._`xy`_, *Y*._`xy`_, *O*._`xy`_ ).
    - The rotation parameter will take the values of *X*._`xy`_, *Y*._`xy`_, *O*._`xy`_ and rotate them ( *O*._`xy`_ being the pivot).
    
    There are two ways you can use the affine:
    - One is using *X*._`xy`_, *Y*._`xy`_, *O*._`xy`_ for everything ( translation, rotation and scale/shear ) 
    - The other is to use the rotation parameter and use *X*._`x`_ and *Y*._`y`_ for scale, *X*._`y`_ and *Y*._`x`_ for share and *O*._`xy`_ for translation.
    
    NOTE:
        The resulting affine coefficients after the rotation parameter is applied are not updated in the UI but passed directly internally to the algorithm.
        
      
post affine:
    #id: FLAME
    Post affine coefficients for the current variations. Those are applied after the variations.
    * See above affine description for more informations.

~~~

    #display: inverted teal

    *FF:* _Final Flame transform._
    
    Final Flame ( FF ) or finalXform iterator act like camera lenses.
    It will take the combined result of all the iterators inside the FLAME Tab
    and apply extra transformations to that result, allowing for a lot of creative exploration.
    
    TIP:
        This finalxform ( FF ) do not posses any color's parameters in this implementation for speed purpose.
        
        When saving a flame out from Fractorium/Apophysis with a finalxform remember to set the Final xform color to:
        - Color -> 0.0
        - Color Speed -> 0.0 ( _this is the most important_ )
        - Direct Color -> 1.0
        
        This way you wont mix in a color to the flame that FLAM3 for Houdini wont be able to match.

    *FF: variations*
    
FF Pre variation:
    #id: FF
    PRE variation to be used. This is applyed before the variations. It is the very first transformation when used.
    * PRE variation act the same way as the Final Flame variations does. It take the combined result of everything you do inside FLAME Tab and transform it using a selected variation.
    * When using parametric variations, its parameters will populate the *PP VARS* Tab.
    
    
FF variations:
    #id: FF
    List of variations to choose from. It take the combined result of everything you do inside FLAME Tab, FF PRE variation, and transform it using those variations.
    While PRE and POST variations act as an assignment, variations are cumulative.
        
    * Variation's name that end with an asterisk(*) are dependent while if they end with 3 dots(...) are parametric. When a parametric variation is selected, its parameters will populate the *VARS* Tab.
    * Final Flame allow up to 3 variations. When using parametric variations, their parameters in the VAR Tab will be shared between all of them. This mean if you use 3 Mobius, they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters.
    
FF Post variations:
    #id: FF
    POST variations to be used. This is applyed after the variations. It is the very last transformation.
    * POST variation act the same way as the Final Flame variations does. It take the combined result of everything you do inside FLAME Tab plus everything you do inside FF Tab and transform it one more time using a selected variation.
    * When using parametric variations, its parameters will populate the *PP VARS* Tab.

    
w:
    #id: FF
    The weight of the selected variation. ZERO will be inactive, 1 will be 100%.
    Can be set higher than 1 and negative too.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        It is better to set a variation weight to ZERO instead of keeping it at a very low values if their contribution isnt noticable to reduce the cost of the computation. At ZERO the variation will be completely ignored.

    *CP:* _Flame fractal color palette._
    
    Palette colors are a very important aspect for a succesful fractal Flame.
    Not only will be essential to play with each iterator's shader parameters
    but experimenting with different palette can make a difference
    and turn a fractal Flame into something really special.
    
HSV:
    #id: PALETTE
    Hue/Saturation/Value of the palette's colors.
    
palette:
    #id: PALETTE
    the actual color palette.
    
Palette name ( preset ):
    #id: PALETTE
    Write a name to give to the selected Palette when saving it out.
    If no name is provided, an automated name composed of today's date and current time will be used instead.
    
Force reload preset:
    #id: PALETTE
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconBlackSVG.svg]
    
    Click this icon to force reload the currently selected palette preset.
    
JSON file:
    #id: PALETTE
    Load an already created json palette lib file or select the name of a new one to create.
    
    TIP:
        Once you are happy with a palette library you built, you can rename the file to start with: "*F3H_LOCK*"
        to prevent any further modifications to it. for example if you have a lib file call: "*my_rainbows_colors.json*"
        you can rename it to: "*F3H_LOCK_my_rainbows_colors.json*" to keep it safe.
        
        _Not as elegant as using chmod in python but it's simple, effective and it has a visual message ( the filename itself )._
        
        _And the advantage is also of acting as locked only within FLAM3 for Houdini_
        _so that if you'd like to manually edit and change some preset names yoursef, you can._

    ((LMB)) to save the current Palette into the selected OUT file.
    
    - If the selected file do not exist, it will be created.
    - If the selected file exist and already contain some Palette in it, it will append the current one.
    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) to erase the content of the file and overwrite it with only the current Palette.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) will open the file explorer to the file location.

    _If the selected file is not a valid Palette JSON file type, nothing will happen._
    
    TIP:
        *Once you click save*:
        
        - If you selected a location and a filename without extension, it will automatically add the _*.json*_ extension to it.
        - If you do not provide a file name at all, it will generate one for you based out of today's date and current time assuming you have a valid location selected.
        - If nothing is selected (ex: JSON file empty or invalid ), nothing will happen.
        
    NOTE:
        - When saving out a palette file, it will try to downsample the usual 256 color count standard.
        - However, when saving out flames files, it will always sample the palette as a 256 colors palette standard.

    *IN: Load* *.flame file created with Apophysis, Fractorium and other.
    
    A *.flame file is an XML format type of file.
        
    NOTE:
        To be valid to be loaded inside FLAM3 for Houdini, a *.flame file must obey this rule:
        
        _the XML file need to start with: <*flames*> and end with: </*flames*>._
        
        All the different Flames ( if multiple Flames are present in the file ) will be inbetween those keys.
        
        When you use Apophysis or Fractorium and copy a Flame to the clipboard
        the above keys are missing so to be able to load it inside FLAM3 for Houdini
        just add those yourself.
        
        Also some of the Flames you find online have those keys missing.
        
        Everything will be correctly set when saving Flames out of Apophysis and Fractorium when using the File->Save menu option as well as saving Flames out with FLAM3 for Houdini.

IN file ( *.flame type ):
    #id: IN
    Load *.flame files authored with Apophysis, Fractorium and other flam3 compatile aplications.
    
    Only restrictions are:
    
    - The Flames contained in the file must use the same variations included inside FLAM3 for Houdini. 
    - A maximum of 4 VARS plus PRE_BLUR plus 2 PRE and 1 POST variations for each iterator are allowed. 
    ( for a total of 8 vars per iterator ). If it find more on Load, it will just discard the extra one.
    - For FF ( FinalXForm ) you have 1 PRE, 2 VARS plus 2 POST available. If it find more on Load, it will just discard the extra one.
    
    NOTE:
        FLAM3 for Houdini do not deal with any image color correction curves that are present inside Fractorium for example.
        Every time you load a Flame authored with Fractorium, those curve's values will be discarded and internally re-set to their default values. ( no color correction at all )
    
Reload:
    #id: IN
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconWhiteSVG.svg]
    
    ((LMB)) to reload the selected preset.
    This is useful when you are working with for example Fractorium
    while importing the same Flame file also in FLAM3 for houdini.
    - You can edit the Flame in Fractorium, save it and click this to reload and see the changes in Houdini.
    
Presets:
    #id: IN
    Every *.flame file can contain multiple Flames.
    This presets will populate with as many entries as the number of Flames included in the file you are loading.
    Each entry will show the name of each Flame.
    
Iterations on Load (int):
    #id: IN
    Set a number of iterations to use every time you load a Flame from a *.flame file.
    This will override the internally default value of 64 iterations.
    
    TIP:
        If "*auto add iter num to Flame name*" OUT Tab option is *OFF*:
    
        When choosing a preset name for your fractal Flame, you can bake into it the iteration number you want it to use once you load it back into FLAM3 for Houdini.
        For example if you name a Flame preset: "*My_Awesome_GrandJulia*" it will be loaded with a default 64 iterations.
        But if you append the iteration number after a double colons to the preset name like so: "*My_Awesome_GrandJulia::16*" it will override all settings
        and load it using 16 as iteration numbers.
        
        So make some tests before you save it out and pick the optimal iteration number to bake into its preset name.
        
        Optionally, you can manually edit the generated XML/Flame file and modify the *flame-> "name"* key yourself after the fact if you desire so.
    
Force iterations on Load:
    #id: IN
    When loading *.flame files, FLAM3 for Houdini will load them in
    and automatically set the iterations number to 64, witch seem a fair amount to resolve most of them fairly well.
    However, sometime you just want to be quick and you can override the iterations set on load using this value.

    Turn it OFF if you desire to use "pre_gaussian_blur" instead and behave as a pre variation ( not cumulative/additive ).
    
    NOTE:
        *You need to reload the current Flame preset for this change to take place*.

    *OUT:* _Save *.flame file type to be loaded back inside Apophysis, Fractorium and others._
    
    Inside here, you can export your fractal Flame out into an XML format. ( standard *.flame file format )
    and re load it in inside FLAM3H or inside Apophysis, Fractorium and others.
    
    The flame file format do not support animations, but only static frames so to speak.
    If you animated your fractal Flame, save the hip file from Houdini instead.
    
    TIP:
        FLAM3 for Houdini allow you to save out your Flames in the standard *.flame file format 
        so that you can load them back inside any other applications like Fractorium, Apophysis and others.
        
        The original flame file format impose you some rules you must obey.
        
        The most important to remember is not to use multiple instances of the same variation in any of the available sections ( PRE, VAR, POST ).
        
        For example you can not use 2 Mobius variations inside the PRE section of an iterator, neither inside the VAR section.
        You can however use 1 Mobius inside the PRE vars, 1 Mobius inside the VAR and 1 Mobius inside the POST.
        
        FLAM3 for Houdini, by design will allow you to be more flexible with your Flame construction choises and allow
        you to bend this rule enabling the use of the same variation multiple time within the same section ( _Chaotica style_ ), but you wont be able to save out
        the result in the standard flame file format. *Save the hip file instead in those cases*.
    
OUT file ( *.flame type ):
    #id: OUT
    Select a file name to save your Flame into.
    If the selected file do not exist, it will be created.

        - If nothing is selected (ex: OUT file empty or invalid ), nothing will happen.
        
    NOTE:
        When saving Flames out, remember you are not allowed to use the same variation more than once in any of the availabe var's sections. 
        While this is doable within the tool, it is not compatible with FLAM3 file format as it require that a variation is used only once per type ( PRE, VAR, POST )
        or you wont be able to save out the same result.
        Save the hip file instead.
        
        This is true also for applications like Apophysis and Fractorium as they obey the same rule.
    
Flame name ( preset ):
    #id: OUT
    Write a name to give to the selected Flame when saving it out.
    If no name is provided, an automated name composed of today's date and current time will be used instead.
    
    TIP:
        If "*auto add iter num to Flame name*" is *OFF*:
    
        When choosing a preset name for your fractal Flame, you can bake into it the iteration number you want it to use once you load it back into FLAM3 for Houdini.
        For example if you name a Flame preset: "*My_Awesome_GrandJulia*" it will be loaded with a default 64 iterations.
        But if you append the iteration number after a double colons to the preset name like so: "*My_Awesome_GrandJulia::16*" it will override all settings
        and load it using 16 as iteration numbers.
        
        So make some tests before you save it out and pick the optimal iteration number to bake into its preset name.
        
        Optionally, you can manually edit the generated XML/Flame file and modify the *flame-> "name"* key yourself after the fact if you desire so.
    
Flame name tip:
    #id: OUT
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconBluStarSVG.svg]
    
    Show Flame name's informations and tips.
    
OUT file contents ( info ):
    #id: OUT
    This menu is only for information purpose.
    It will show the Flames contained in the selected output file if any are presents.
    Once you append a new Flame in it, this menu will update too.
    It will always be set to the last Flame's name you saved.

    #display: rounded white

    *OUT: options*
        
Save palette HSV (cc):
    #id: OUT
    OFF by default as FLAM3 for Houdini will save out the HSV values into the XML file
    so to set those once you load it back.
    If checked, the Flame's palette will be saved out using the HSV Ramp
    so to store any color corrections you may have done.
    This is useful if you plan to load the saved Flame into an other application
    like Fractorium and Apophisis and keep the color corrected palette with it.
    
Auto add iter num to Flame name:
    #id: OUT
    ON by default. It will automatically append the iteration number to the Flame name you enter.
    It will also auto correct the Flame name string based on internally defined rules.
    
    TIP:
        When on, and once you type in a Flame name, changing the iteration number will update the Flame name too.

    *OUT: Render properties*
    

OUT render properties:
    #id: OUT
    Those properties are specific of the renderer of the application you will load the saved Flame into.
    Some of the properties are specific to Fractorium application, witch has been my reference for this.
    
    NOTE:
        Those properties will control how the saved fractal Flame will render
        inside other applications like Fractorium and Apophysis.
        
        They are their renderer settings and they will be exported into the XML file.
    
Edit render properties:
    #id: OUT
    Allow the editing of the render properties for the host application you will load the saved Flame file into.
    Fractorium being the suggested one followed by Apophysis.
    
    Changing those values, will change how the saved Flame will render inside those applications.
    
    NOTE:
        FLAM3 for Houdini do not deal with any image color correction curves that are present inside Fractorium for example.
        Every time you save a Flame out from FLAM3 for Houdini, those curves will be re-written with their default values. ( no color correction at all )
        
        This mean that if you load a Flame authored with Fractorium that uses its color correction curves, they will be lost once you save the Flame out again from FLAM3 for Houdini.

@rendering Rendering tips

:box:
    #display: inverted pink

    *FLAM3H Rendering tips*. A few small tips to render your fractal Flame images.


== Rendering: workflow tips == (REND)

Workflow tips:
    #id: rendering
    
    You can keep FLAM3H node live, without the need to bake the processed point cloud while rendering
    and just change density values to go from low/quick renders to high/slow render times. Adjust the point size *`@pscale`* ( in Solaris: *`@widths`* ) accordingly.

    When using Karma renderer:

    - With *64gb of physical memory* you will be able to render *500M points* without weigth much on virtual memory.
    
    - With *128gb of physical memory* you will be able to render *1 bilions points* without weigth much on virtual memory.
    
    TIP:
        When using Mantra, you can take advantage of *delayed loads* to greatly increase the amount of points you can render in wich case you must bake those points out in a *`*.bgeo.sc`* files first.


== Rendering: Point size == (REND)

Point size:
    #id: rendering
    
    FLAM3 for Houdini set all *`@pscale`* to a value of *`0.001`* for convenience.
    Use the upstream geometry node point size multiplier or a wrangle to adjust it as needed.
    When importing FLAM3 into Stage/Solaris remember that *`@pscale`* will become *`@widths`*.
    
    TIP:
        As a general rule, the more points the smaller the *`@pscale`* or *`@widths`* values need to be.


== Rendering: Helpful settings == (REND)

Karma/Mantra tips:
    #id: Karma/Mantra tips
    
    - *When rendering with Karma*, remember to thick ON "*Simplified lighting*"/"*Disable lighting*" option to be sure to render the points with their full color values.
    
    - *When rendering with Mantra*, just create a constant shader that use the *`@Cd`* attribute.
    
    Playing with the CP Ramp HSV values will be very important, especially the "*S*"( Saturation ) and most importantly the "*V*"( Value ).
    Increasing the Value in the HSV from the default 1.0, will help making the more dense areas of the Flame brighters, giving it something closer to the usual fractal Flame look.

@Cvex

:box:
    #display: inverted pink

    *FLAM3H Cvex: How to compile and updated*. In this section you will find informations on how to compile and then aupdated FLAM3H CVEX code in case you'd like to modify/extend its core functionalities.
    For example you may want to add more variations to its current arsenal of already implemented variations ( currently there are 106 ).
    
    Extending the Cvex code base, most likely will require you to update/extend the Python code base as well since both goes hand in hand in many of the core algorithm functionalities.
    
    NOTE:
        The current form of the cvex code base has been reduced to the very possible minimum in favor of speed, it is the least amount of code needed to implement the whole algorithm.
        If you add anything, be as conservative as you can possibly be.


== Cvex: How to compile == (COMPILE)

Compile CVEX:
    #id: CVEX
    
:box:
    #display: rounded white
    
    *SideFX made this part very easy*:
    
    * Open a Houdini 19.x Command line Tools shell
    * Navigate into the directory where the cvex source files are located
    * To compile any of the available cvex source files, run this command:
    
    {{{
    #!vex
    vcc -c cvex sourceFile.vfl -o outputFile.vex
    }}}
    
    - *vcc* is the name of the Houdini's cvex/vex compiler
    - *-c* to specify a Houdini context, in this case the context is: *cvex*
    - *-o* to specify an output filename ( *.vex* extension )
    
    The FLAM3H source files are already named as expected.
    
    - For FLAM3H, the output file name must be the same as the input source file name ( only the file extension will be different, of course ).
    
        - Source: _*TheFractalFlameAlgorithm.vfl*_ 
    
        - Output: _*TheFractalFlameAlgorithm.vex*_
    
== Cvex: How to update FLAM3H node == (UPDATE)

Reload CVEX:
    #id: CVEX
    
:box:
    #display: rounded white
    
    Inside FLAM3H node, you will find many wrangle core nodes running a compiled cvex file.
    
    If you end up updating the cvex code yourself by extending it: 
    
    - Updated the sourceFile.*vfl* with all the changes/additions you desire, follow the above steps on *How to: Compile CVEX*.
    - Once you are ready, remove the old compiled cvex file from: *FLAM3H*->*Type properties*->*extra files*.
    - Locate the new compiled cvex file and load it back inside *FLAM3H*->*Type properties*->*extra files* section.
    - Before you click: *Add file*, remove the extension from the filename inside the "*Section name*"
        - ex: From: _*TheFractalFlameAlgorithm.vex*_ To: _*TheFractalFlameAlgorithm*_
    - Click *Apply* or *Accept* to confirm your changes.
    - Go inside the FLAM3H node and on any of the wrangle cores nodes click the: Reload CVEX icon:
    
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconFcvexSVG.svg]
    
    You just need to click it once, and it will reload all the compiled cvex code files included, the wrangleCore node you click the icon from is not important.

@Limitations

:box:
    #display: inverted pink

    *FLAM3H: Limitations*. The following are limitations to keep in mind when authoring your Flame in Fractorium or Apophysis to be then loaded inside FLAM3 for Houdini. All those limitations are in place to keep performance acceptable within the CVEX language limits.
    

== FLAME: Number of iterators ==

Iterator's count:
    #id: Limitations
    
    FLAM3 for Houdini allow you to create as many iterators as you wish, however when using XAOS you are allowed to create max 20 iterators.

== FLAME: xform's PRE, VAR and POST variations ==

PRE variations:
    #id: Limitations
    
    Every iterator is capabable of 3 PRE variations, with one ( the first one to always be executed ) being: pre_blur, followed by the other two.
    
    It is really pre_blur + 2 variations of your choice.
    
    NOTE:
        _*The weight of the PRE variations can not be negative*_ in FLAM3 for Houdini.

VAR variations:
    #id: Limitations
    
    Every iterator is capable of 4 variations.
    
POST variations:
    #id: Limitations
    
    Every iterator is capable of 1 POST variation.
    
    NOTE:
        _*The weight of the POST variation can not be negative*_ in FLAM3 for Houdini.
        
Parametric variation parameters:
    #id: Limitations
    
    Each iterator has only one set of parametric variation parameters shared within PRE, VAR and POST variations.
    This mean if you use 2 PRE_Mobius, 4 Mobius and 1 POST_Mobius, they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters.
    
    
    
== FF: finalxform's PRE, VAR and POST variations ==

FF PRE variations:
    #id: Limitations
    
    FF iterator is capabable of 1 PRE variation.
    
    NOTE:
        _*The weight of the FF PRE variations can not be negative*_ in FLAM3 for Houdini.

FF VAR variations:
    #id: Limitations
    
    FF iterator is capable of 2 variations.
    
FF POST variations:
    #id: Limitations
    
    FF iterator is capable of 2 POST variations.
    
    NOTE:
        _*The weight of the FF POST variation can not be negative*_ in FLAM3 for Houdini.
        
FF Parametric variation parameters:
    #id: Limitations
    
    FF iterator has two sets of parametric variations parameters.
    One is shared with VAR variations.
    The second is shared within PRE and POST variations.
    
    This mean if you use 4 Mobius, they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters from set one ( FF: VARS Tab ),
    
    but if you use 1 PRE_Mobius and 2 POST_Mobius they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters from set two ( FF: PP VARS Tab ).
    
== FF: Shader ==

FF Shader:
    #id: Limitations
    
    This finalxform ( FF ) do not posses any color's parameters in this implementation ( Chaotica style ).

    NOTE:
        When saving a Flame out from Fractorium/Apophysis with a finalxform remember to set the Final xform color to:
        - Color -> 0.0
        - Color Speed -> 0.0 ( _this is the most important_ )
        - Direct Color -> 1.0
        
        This way you wont mix in a color to the Flame that FLAM3 for Houdini wont be able to match.
