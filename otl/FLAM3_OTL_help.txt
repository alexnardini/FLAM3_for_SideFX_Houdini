_A huge special thanks and lots of gratitude toward my family who kept up with me for so long while I was inside the fractal Flame bubble!_

@parameters

NOTE:
    FLAM3 for Houdini set all *`@pscale`* to a value of *`0.001`* for convenience.
    Use the upstream geometry node point size multiplier or a wrangle to adjust it as needed.
    When importing FLAM3 into Stage/Solaris remember that *`@pscale`* will become *`@widths`*.

    *GLOBAL*

density:
    #id: GLOBAL
    Number of points to use. For high qualty fractals start from 20M up to 500M and more depending the type of Fractal Flame you are ending up with. As a general rule, the more the better.
    * Must find the sweet spot between quality and processing time.
    
iterations:
    #id: GLOBAL
    Number of iterations to use.
    * You dnt need many iterations to get some good Fractal Flames going, between 10 and 24 is usually more than you need while keeping execution speed acceptable.
    However, if you increase an iterator weight, use xaos to build containers or use some kind of variations you will require higher number to resolve and show you the proper result.
    Almost all of the fractal flame showcased inside FLAM3 for Houdini website/instagram account use less than 64 iterations with a few exceptions reaching 96 and in rare cases 128/256.

    *FLAME:* _Flame variations/iterators._

iterators:
    #id: FLAME
    Number of iterators to use.
    * This is equivalent to the number of triangle handles you have inside popular fractal flame editors out there.
    
~~~

note:
    #id: FLAME
    Set a short descriptive note about this iterator.
    
copy/paste:
    #id: FLAME
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconBlackStarSVG.svg]
    
    ((LMB)) to mark this iterator for being copied. 
    
    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) to PASTE the copied values into another iterator. It will copy everything, parametric variation's parameters included but not XAOS.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) will unmark this iterator for being copied.
    
    It will work also between different FLAM3 nodes.
    
    Once you copy an iterator you can have access to the arrow icon menu next to the *F* icon.
    From this menu you will be able to paste specific sections from the copied iterator, xaos incuded.


:box:
    #display: rounded white

    *iterator:#*
    
A:
    #id: FLAME
    Enable/Disable this iterator.
    
    TIP:
        If an iterator is disabled, it wont be included when saving the flame out into a Flame file.
        In case you still want to include the inactive iterator into the file, set its Weight to Zero instead.
    
W:
    #id: FLAME
    The iterator weight. Define the probability this iterator is choosen during the chaos game.
    The higher an iterator weight is compared to the others and the more iterations you may need to properly resolve the Fractal Flame's shapes you are working on..
    
xaos:
    #id: FLAME
    
    NOTE:
        *When using XAOS, you are allowed to use up to 20 iterators max.*
        Using more than 20 iterators will disable the algorithm.
        
        This is a workaround to make XAOS work due to a Houdini bug: *Bug ID# 124486*, *SideFX Support Ticket SESI #128304*
    
    Set XAOS weights or add a extra short descriptive note about this iterator.
    
    The default mode is *xaos TO*. You can change it to use *xaos FROM* mode instead in the preferences tab.
    
    - To set XAOS for a flame with 4 iterators, use the *xaos* keyword followed by each iterator weights values separated by a colon: *xaos:1:2:3:4* ( *xaos* keyword can be uppercase too if you prefer. )
    - If no set or when using a short descriptive note, FLAM3 will assume all XAOS values are 1.0, the equivalent of: *xaos:1:1:1:1*
    - If you set only iterator 1 and iterator 2, FLAM3 will always fill in the rest with a value of 1.0. *xaos:0:0* will be interpreted as *xaos:0:0:1:1*
    - When turning iterators OFF and ON, FLAM3 will internally remove and reformat XAOS values to account for missing iterator so you wont need to remove values from the command string, *unless you delete an iterator in witch case you will require to modify the "XAOS:" string*.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
    
        XAOS is OFF by default and FLAM3 will activate it automatically
        only when needed. (ex: when one of its weights is set to a value different than the others, ex: *xaos:3:3:3:2.9* ).
    
:box:
    #display: rounded white

    *F#: shader*

location:
    #id: FLAME
    The color location in the ramp *{0:1}*.
    
speed:
    #id: FLAME
    Speed of color blending between iterations. Values above ZERO attract the selected color while values below ZERO will repel it.
    
opacity:
    #id: FLAME
    The opacity of the current transform. Opacity 0 means it will be entirely transparent, and opacity 1, entirely opaque. It can be used also to fine tune your fractal, making parts of it more or less prominent in addition to the iterator's weight.
    
:box:
    #display: rounded white

    *F#: variation*
        
pre:
    #id: FLAME
    Enable PRE Variations for the selected iterator.
    
var:
    #id: FLAME
    List of variations to choose from.
    While PRE and POST variations act as an assignment, variations are cumulative.
        
    - Variation's name that end with an asterisk(*) are dependent while if they end with 3 dots(...) are parametric. When a parametric variation is selected, its parameters will populate the *VARS* Tab.
    - Each iterators allow up to 8 variations ( pre-blur var, 2 pre var, 4 vars plus 1 post var) to be used. When using parametric variations, their parameters in the VAR Tab will be shared between all of them. This mean if you use 4 Mobius and 1 post Mobius, they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
    
        A good way to try out the variations, is to laydown a fresh FLAM3 node
        and while using the default Siepinsky triangle activate the Final Flame transform (*FF*)
        and change variations there to see the result. ( remember to play a bit with the AFFINE coefficents to check the results )    

post:
    #id: FLAME
    Enable POST Variation for the selected iterator.
    For speed purpose only one parametric is allowed at the moment.
        
w:
    #id: FLAME
    The weight of the selected variation. ZERO will be inactive, 1 will be 100%.
    Can be set higher than 1 and negative too.
    * If more than one variation is active, remember that as a general rule it is suggested ( not mandatory ) to have the sum of all weights equal to 1.
    
    TIP:
        #display: orange
        
        It is better to set a variation weight to ZERO instead of keeping it at a very low values if their contribution isnt noticable to reduce the cost of the computation. At ZERO the variation will be completely ignored.

post:
    #id: FLAME
    Enable post affine.
    
pre affine:
    #id: FLAME
    Affine coefficients for the current iterator ( xform ).

    Each iterator( xform ) has an affine transform that is always applied on every iteration.
    This is known as the pre affine becasue it is applied before the variations.
    
    
    - With *X*._`xy`_ and *Y*._`xy`_ you will apply rotation and scale/shear while with *O*._`xy`_ you will apply translation/offset.
    - They compose a 2x3 matrix ( *X*._`xy`_, *Y*._`xy`_, *O*._`xy`_ ).
    - The rotation parameter will take the values of *X*._`xy`_, *Y*._`xy`_, *O*._`xy`_ and rotate them ( *O*._`xy`_ being the pivot).
    
    There are two ways you can use the affine:
    - One is using *X*._`xy`_, *Y*._`xy`_, *O*._`xy`_ for everything ( translation, rotation and scale/shear ) 
    - The other is to use the rotation parameter and use *X*._`x`_ and *Y*._`y`_ for scale, *X*._`y`_ and *Y*._`x`_ for share and *O*._`xy`_ for translation.
    
    NOTE:
        The resulting affine coefficients after the rotation parameter is applied are not updated in the UI but passed directly internally to the algorithm.
        
      
post affine:
    #id: FLAME
    Post affine coefficients for the current variations. Those are applied after the variations.
    * See above affine description for more informations.

    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) on another FLAM3 node to PASTE the copied FF values. It will copy everything, parametric variation's parameters included.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) will unmark the FF for being copied.
    
    It will only work between different FLAM3 nodes.
    
    Once you copy the FF, on another FLAM3 node you can have access to the arrow icon menu next to the *F* icon.
    From this menu you will be able to paste specific sections from the marked FF.

    * Variation's name that end with an asterisk(*) are dependent while if they end with 3 dots(...) are parametric. When a parametric variation is selected, its parameters will populate the *VARS* Tab.
    * Final Flame allow up to 3 variations. When using parametric variations, their parameters in the VAR Tab will be shared between all of them. This mean if you use 3 Mobius, they will all share the same *`re:abcd`* and *`im:abcd`* parameters.
    
FF Post variations:
    #id: FF
    POST variations to be used. This is applyed after the variations. It is the very last transformation.
    * POST variation act the same way as the Final Flame variations does. It take the combined result of everything you do inside FLAME Tab plus everything you do inside FF Tab and transform it one more time using a selected variation.
    * When using parametric variations, its parameters will populate the *PP VARS* Tab.

    Click this icon to force reload the currently selected palette preset.
    
JSON file:
    #id: PALETTE
    Load an already created json palette lib file or select the name of a new one to create.
    
    TIP:
        Once you are happy with a palette library you built, you can rename the file to start with: "*F3H_LOCK*"
        to prevent any further modifications to it. for example if you have a lib file call: "*my_rainbows_colors.json*"
        you can rename it to: "*F3H_LOCK_my_rainbows_colors.json*" to keep it safe.

    - ((CTRL)) + ((LMB)) to erase the content of the file and overwrite it with only the current Palette.
    - ((SHIFT)) + ((LMB)) will open the file explorer to the file location.

    _If the selected file is not a valid Palette JSON file type, nothing will happen._
    
    TIP:
        *Once you click save*:
        
        - If you selected a location and a filename without extension, it will automatically add the _*.json*_ extension to it.
        - If you do not provide a file name at all, it will generate one for you based out of today's date and current time assuming you have a valid location selected.
        - If nothing is selected (ex: JSON file empty or invalid ), nothing will happen.
        
    NOTE:
        - When saving out a palette file, it will try to downsample the usual 256 color count standard.
        - However, when saving out flames files, it will always sample the palette as a 256 colors palette standard.

    *IN: Load *.flame file created with Apophysis, Fractorium and other.

IN file ( *.flame type ):
    #id: IN
    Load *.flame files authored with Apophysis, Fractorium and other flam3 compatile aplications.
    
    Only restrictions are:
    
    - The flames contained in the file must use the same variations included inside FLAM3 for Houdini. 
    - A maximum of 4 VARS plus PRE_BLUR plus 2 PRE and 1 POST variations for each iterator are allowed. 
    ( for a total of 8 vars per iterator ). 
    - For FF ( FinalXForm ) you have 1 PRE, 2 VARS plus 2 POST available.
    
Reload:
    #id: IN
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconWhiteSVG.svg]
    
    ((LMB)) to reload the selected preset.
    This is useful when you are working with for example Fractorium
    while importing the same flame file also in FLAM3 for houdini.
    - You can edit the flame in Fractorium, save it and click this to reload and see the changes in Houdini.
    
Presets:
    #id: IN
    Every *.flame file can contain multiple flames.
    This presets will populate with as many entries as the number of flames included in the file you are loading.
    Each entry will show the name of each flame.
    
Iterations on Load (int):
    #id: IN
    Set a number of iterations to use every time you load a flame from a *.flame file.
    This will override the internally default value of 64 iterations.
    
    TIP:
        Every .flame file, if you open it manually for editing has its name stored into the "*flame -> name*" attribute in the XML tree.
        You can edit it yourself and add the iteration number youd like it to use on load addding a double colon *::* followed by the iteration numner.
        
        For example if a flame name is "*my_beautiful_juliascope*", you can change it to "*my_beautiful_juliascope::24*" so it will set automatically the iteration number to 24 once loaded overriding any other settings.
    
Use iterations on Load:
    #id: IN
    When loading *.flame files, FLAM3 for Houdini will load them in
    and automatically set the iterations number to 64, witch seem a fair amount to resolve most of them fairly well.
    However, sometime you just want to be quick and you can override the iterations set on load using this value.
    
infos:
    #id: IN
    Display information about the Flame preset loaded.
    
Render infos:
    #id: IN
    Display informations about the render properties of the loaded Flame preset.
    Those properties are specific of the renderer of the application the loaded Flame has been created/saved from.
    Some of the properties are specific to Fractorium application, witch has been my reference for this.
    
Copy/Paste render properties:
    #id: IN
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconBlackStarSVG.svg]
    
    Clicking this icon will copy those render properties and paste them inside the OUT tab render properties.
    This way you can be sure your Flame will match the visual quality of the flame you just loaded once you save it out and load it back in Fractorium for example.

    _If the selected file is not a valid Flame file type, nothing will happen._
    
    
    TIP:
        *Once you click save*:
        
        - If you selected a location and a filename without extension, it will automatically add the _*.flame*_ extension to it.
        - If you do not provide a file name at all, it will generate one for you based out of today's date and current time assuming you have a valid location selected.
        - If nothing is selected (ex: OUT file empty or invalid ), nothing will happen.
        
    NOTE:
        When saving Flames out, remember you are not allowed to use the same variation more than once in any of the availabe var's sections. 
        While this is doable within the tool, it is not compatible with FLAM3 file format as it require that a variation is used only once per type ( PRE, VAR, POST )
        or you wont be able to save out the same result.
        Save the hip file instead.
        
        This is true also for applications like Apophysis and Fractorium as they obey the same rule.
        
OUT file contents ( info ):
    #id: OUT
    This menu is only for information purpose.
    It will show the Flames contained in the selected output file if any are presents.
    Once you append a new Flame in it, this menu will update too.
    It will always be set to the last Flame's name you saved.
    
Flame name ( preset ):
    #id: OUT
    Write a name to give to the selected flame when saving it out.
    If no name is provided, an automated name composed of today's date and current time will be used instead.
    
    TIP:
        When choosing a name for your fractal flame, you can bake into it the iteration number you want it to use once you load it back into FLAM3 for Houdini.
        For example if you call a flame: "*My_Awesome_GrandJulia.flame*" it will be loaded with a default 64 iterations.
        But if you append the iteration number after a double colons like so: "*My_Awesome_GrandJulia::16.flame*" it will override all settings
        and it will be loaded using 16 as iteration numbers.
        
        So make some tests before you save it out and pick the optimal iteration number to bake into its name.
        
        Optionally, you can manually edit the generated XML/Flame file and modify the *flame-> "name"* key yourself after the fact if you desire so.
    
Use palette HSV (cc):
    #id: OUT
    If checked, the Flame's palette will be saved out using the HSV ramp so to carry out any color correction the user may have done if he like so.

    
OUT render properties:
    #id: OUT
    Those properties are specific of the renderer of the application you will load the saved Flame into.
    Some of the properties are specific to Fractorium application, witch has been my reference for this.
    
Edit render properties:
    #id: OUT
    Allow the editing of the render properties for the host application you will load the saved flame file into.
    Fractorium being the suggested one followed by Apophysis 7x.
    
Reset render properties:
    #id: OUT
    [Largeicon:opdef:.?iconBlackSVG.svg]
    
    Click this icon to reset all OUT render properties.
    
Resolution:
    #id: OUT
    The image resolution.
    
Center:
    #id: OUT
    Where the flame is centered, think of this as the look at camera point.
    
Rotate:
    #id: OUT
    The camera rotation.
    
Scale:
    #id: OUT
    The camera zoom.
    
Quality:
    #id: OUT
    The render quality. Think of this as how many points are used inside Fractorium to render the final image. The more the more cleaner the final image.
    
Brightness:
    #id: OUT
    The flame render setting: brightness.
    
Gamma:
    #id: OUT
    The flame render setting: gamma.
    
Highlight power:
    #id: OUT
    The flame render setting: highlight power.
    
Logscale K2:
    #id: OUT
    The flame render setting: Logscale K2.
    
Vibrancy:
    #id: OUT
    The flame render setting: vibrancy.
